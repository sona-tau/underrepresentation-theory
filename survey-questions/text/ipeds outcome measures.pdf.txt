2016-17 Entering Undergraduate Cohort

July 1, 2016-June 30, 2017: Full Year

Begin by identifying your entering degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates for the full year of July 1, 2016 - June 30, 2017. Then report each student under one of the eight subcohorts (Pell or Non-Pell Grant recipients FTFT, FTPT, NFTFT, NFTPT). Each entering student should be reported only once.

The four cohorts and total entering students will be calculated based on your subcohort reporting.

NOTE: Once a student is in the cohort, the student remains in the cohort, even if the student's attendance status changes (i.e., full-time to part-time, or vice versa) or if the student drops out, transfers out, or transfers back into the institution during the eight-year period. However, institutions can make adjustments to the cohort for allowable exclusions, which include the death of a student, total and permanent disability, military deployment, or service on an official church mission or with a foreign aid service of the Federal government. Exclusions are for the ENTIRE eight years for the entering 2016-17 cohort.
