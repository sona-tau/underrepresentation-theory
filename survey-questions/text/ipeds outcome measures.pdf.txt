Begin by identifying your entering degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates for the full year of July 1, 2016 - June 30, 2017. Then report each student under one of the eight subcohorts (Pell or Non-Pell Grant recipients FTFT, FTPT, NFTFT, NFTPT). Each entering student should be reported only once.

From the adjusted 2016-17 cohort, report the number of students who earned an award at six years after entry for each subcohort. Report the highest award earned for each degree/certificate-seeking student for the six-year status point (August 31, 2022) even if a student earns multiple awards.

From the adjusted 2016-17 cohort, report the number of students who earned an award at eight years after entry for each subcohort. Report the highest award earned for each degree/certificate-seeking student for the eight-year status point (August 31, 2024) even if a student earns multiple awards.
