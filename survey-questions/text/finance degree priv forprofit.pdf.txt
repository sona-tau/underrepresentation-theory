Income Tax Expenses (if applicable)

Balance Sheet Information

Summary of Changes in Equity

Scholarships and Fellowships

General Instructions



Reporting Period Covered

The starting point for reporting should be amounts reported in the GPFS for the most recent fiscal year ending before October 1, 2024. For institutions with fiscal years ending on December 31, this would be the calendar year 2023.



About the Data

Data providers for this component should be familiar with college and university accounting policies and practices as described by the National Association of College and University Business Officers (NACUBO). To provide additional help, accounting terms are underlined and linked to definitions found in the online glossary.

Four different types of data appear in this component. There are data:

Institutions provide from their GPFS and/or underlying records.

That are prior year data, shown in red, which can be used as a comparison with the current year's data being reported. That are carried forward from one part of the component to another part to ensure that the data are internally consistent. Calculated from the other data elements.

In the latter two cases, the data provider is requested to check that the carried forward data and the calculated data are consistent with the data found in the



https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/public/survey-materials/forms?surveyid=5&instructionid=29012&formid=12 15/27 institution's GPFS. If the data carried forward or calculated are not consistent with the institution's GPFS, then an error in data entry may have occurred.





Context Boxes

Context boxes are provided to allow institutions to provide more information regarding survey component items. Note that some context boxes are posted on

the College Navigator Website, which is the college search tool offered by NCES. NCES will review entries in these context boxes for applicability and

appropriateness before posting them on the College Navigator Website; institutions should check grammar and spelling of their entries.





Coverage



What to Include

The reporting entity's financial accounting policies and procedures should be the beginning basis for reporting to this IPEDS survey component. However, deviations from the GPFS may be required to respond to this IPEDS survey component. Some of these deviations include:

If financial categories in the institution’s GPFS are more aggregated than required for this IPEDS survey component, then use underlying institutional records to determine the necessary amounts.

If financial categories in the institution’s GPFS are more detailed than required, then combine the GPFS amounts and report only the combined number for this IPEDS survey component.

If amounts are reported in categories in the GPFS that differ from those required for the IPEDS survey, move those amounts to the IPEDS-requested categories.

Report all financial amounts in WHOLE DOLLARS only, omitting cents.

For any item on the survey component where exact data do not exist in the GPFS, please give estimates.



What NOT to Include

Do not report any projected amounts for future years. Do not make adjustments for prior-year corrections unless they are included as such corrections in the GPFS.





Additional Instructions for Institutions Reporting Finance Data for Other Institutions

Most degree-granting institutions reporting IPEDS data report all their data for each IPEDS survey component, including the Finance survey component. However, some institutions (called “children”) are set up to report only certain parts of the IPEDS Finance survey component, while the “parent” institution reports all portions of the Finance survey component but does NOT double count those items already reported by the children institutions. Here is what each type of institution should report:



Part Parent Institution Child Institution

Part F – Income Taxes Reports sum of parent and child data Does not report

Part A – Balance Sheet Reports sum of parent and child data Does not report

Part B – Summary of Change in Equity Reports sum of parent and child data Does not report

Part C-1 – Scholarships and Fellowships Reports parent data only Reports child data only

Part C-2 – Sources of Discounts and Allowances Reports parent data only Reports child data only

Part D – Revenues and Investment Return Reports parent data only Reports child data only

Part E-1 – Expenses and Other Deductions: Functional Classification Reports parent data only Reports child data only

Part E-2 – Expenses and Other Deductions: Natural Classification Reports parent data only Reports child data only

Part G - Financial Health Reports sum of Parent and Child data Does not report

Parent institutions should report the sum of parent and child data for Parts A, B and G, and should report parent data only in parts C, D and E. This is done so that scholarships and fellowships, revenues and investment return, and expenses and other deductions by functional and natural classifications are not double counted by parent and child institutions.

Detailed Instructions

This section provides line-by-line instructions for each Part of the Finance Component.

In the instructions, numbers found in parentheses at the end of each line provide additional reference to paragraphs in the National Association of College and Universities' Business Officers' (NACUBO) Financial Accounting and Reporting Manual (FARM). There are also some references to the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS).



General Information

Fiscal Year: Enter the beginning and ending dates of the period covered for the reported financial data.

Audit Opinion: Check the appropriate box to indicate if the GPFS received an unqualified opinion from your auditors. A "qualified opinion" occurs when the auditor includes exceptions to the opinion that "The financial statements present fairly, in all respects, the financial position as of (date) and the results of the operations for the year ended, in conformity with accounting standards generally accepted in the United States." When no such exceptions are included, the opinion is considered "unqualified." If “qualified” is checked, please note in the context box the nature of the qualification. If the statements have not been audited, please check “Don’t know OR in progress” and note in the context box that the GPFS are unaudited.

Pell Grants: Indicate whether the institution accounts for Pell Grants as pass-through payments or as federal revenue. If the institution does not award Pell Grants, select the applicable option.

Institutions that do receive Pell Grants have the option to report Pell Grants either as:

Federal revenue and allowance to tuition and fees and/or auxiliary enterprises (for food and housing, books, etc.). If the Pell Grant is counted as federal revenue, then there should be an offsetting discount/allowance to tuition and fees revenue and/or auxiliary enterprise revenue so that the Pell Grants are not being double counted in the institution’s revenues. It is rare for private-for-profit institutions to treat Pell Grants this way. Do not choose this option unless you are absolutely certain it's correct.

OR

As a pass-through transaction. A pass-through transaction is essentially a payment on the student’s account where the institution is purely processing the Pell Grant and those monies are not counted by the institution until they come in as a tuition payment from the student. This option is sometimes referred to as an agency transaction. With this option Pell Grants are not counted as federal revenues and are not considered to be a discount/allowance to tuition and fees or auxiliary enterprises.

Please note that regardless of how Pell Grants are treated for revenues or expenses they should still be reported in Part C-1: Scholarships and Fellowships under Pell Grants.



Business Structure: Check the appropriate box to indicate the institution’s business structure for tax purposes. If either a C Corporation or a Limited Liability Company (LLC) business structure is selected, the institution will be required to report “Federal” and “State and Local” income tax expenditures in Part F (if applicable).





Part F – Income Tax Expenses

This section is only applicable to those institutions that have either a C Corporation or a Limited Liability Company (LLC) business structure. The institution should follow the Basic Principles for Income Tax Accounting, as outlined in FASB SFAS 109.

01 – Federal – Report the sum of the current Federal tax expense (or benefit) and deferred Federal tax expense (or benefit).

02 – State and Local – Report the sum of the current State and Local tax expense (or benefit) and deferred State and Local tax expense (or benefit).

Negative income tax expenditures may occur as a result of:

An increase in the net deferred tax asset at the end of the fiscal year



https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/public/survey-materials/forms?surveyid=5&instructionid=29012&formid=12 17/27

A decrease in the net deferred tax liability at the end of the fiscal year

03 – Tax Structure - Please designate who paid the reported tax expenses for your institution:

Taxes were aggregate amounts paid by the multi-institution or multi-campus organization indicated in IC-Header for all associated institutions. This option is applicable if the reported income tax expenses in Part F are amounts paid by the multi-institution or multi-campus organization indicated by your institution in Part B of the IC-Header component. The aggregate amounts are tax expenses paid by the organization for all institutions that it owns, governs, or controls.

Taxes were aggregate amounts paid by a multi-institution or multi-campus organization NOT indicated in IC-Header for all associated institutions. This option is applicable if the reported income tax expenses in Part F are amounts paid by a multi-institution or multi-campus organization that was not indicated in Part B of the IC-Header component, which can include a subsidiary of the organization indicated in IC-Header. The aggregate amounts are tax expenses paid by the organization for all institutions that it owns, governs, or controls.

Taxes were amounts paid by the reporting institution. This option is applicable to institutions, including those in IPEDS parent/child relationships, that do not belong to a multi-institution or multi-campus organization. The reported amounts are tax expenses paid by the institution.



A multi-institution or multi-campus organization includes organizations with two or more institutions or campuses. Non-postsecondary education agencies that govern or control institutions include, but are not limited to, public school districts, art organizations, hospitals and other medical/health organizations.

Do not include:

coordinating systems

single institution owner

single institution corporate name

single institution governing board

consortia

associations

religious affiliation

Note that under the GAAP, when a company is in a valuation allowance position, they are no longer allowed to record a tax benefit related to their current year pretax losses until the valuation allowance is determined to be more likely than not realized. Institutions that recognized valuation measurements for the Fiscal Year should state this in the context box provided.





Part A – Balance Sheet Information, Page 1

This part is intended to report institutional assets, liabilities, and equity.

Financial data should agree with the GPFS.

01) Total Assets – Enter the amount from your GPFS which is the sum of:

a) Cash, cash equivalents, and temporary investments;

b) Receivables, net (net of allowance for uncollectible amounts);

c) Inventories, prepaid expenses, and deferred charges;

d) Amounts held by trustees for construction and debt service;

e) Long-term investments;

f) Plant, property, and equipment; and,

g) Other assets

These terms are discussed below.

a) Cash, cash equivalents, and temporary investments – Cash equivalents are short term, highly liquid investments that are 1) readily converted to cash, and 2) so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates.

Long-term investments should be distinguished from temporary investments based on the intention of the organization regarding the term of the investment rather than the nature of the investment itself. Thus, cash and cash equivalents which are held until appropriate long-term investments are identified should be treated as long-term investments. Similarly, cash equivalents strategically invested and reinvested for long-term purposes should be treated as long-term investments. (FARM para. 415)

01b) Property, plant, and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation – Includes end-of-year historical cost for categories such as land, buildings, improvements other than buildings, equipment, and library books, combined and net of accumulated depreciation. (FARM para. 415)

g) Other liabilities – Include all other liabilities not reported elsewhere.

02a) Debt related to property, plant, and equipment – Include amounts for all long-term debt obligations including bonds payable, mortgages payable, capital leases payable, and long-term notes payable. (FARM para. 420.3, 423) If the current portion of long-term debt is separately reported in the GPFS, include that amount.

03) Total equity – The amount calculated here is important because it will be carried forward to Part B. This amount is calculated as the difference between total assets reported on line 01 and total liabilities reported on line 02. The calculated value should equal the amount from your GPFS which is the sum of:

a) Stock (common, preferred, treasury, etc.) and additional paid-in-capital;

(SFAS Numbers 115 and 130.)

04) Total liabilities and equity – This amount is calculated as the sum of total liabilities reported on line 02 and total equity calculated on line 03. This amount equals total assets reported on line 01.





Part A – Balance Sheet Information, Page 2

Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property obtained under capital leases should be reported in the categories that best describe the property, such as equipment, buildings, etc. (FARM para. 415)

Gross Asset Amounts – The amounts on lines A05 – A09 are the total carrying amounts, without reducing the amounts for accumulated depreciation.

05) Land and land improvements – Provide end of year values for land and land improvements as a reconciliation of beginning of the year values with additions to and retirements of land and land improvements to obtain end of year values. Use your underlying institutional records.

06) Buildings – End of year values for buildings represent a reconciliation of beginning of the year values with additions to and retirements of building values to obtain end of year values. Capitalized leasehold improvements should be included on this line if the improvements are related to leased facilities.

07) Equipment, including art and library collections – End of year values for equipment represents a reconciliation of beginning of the year values with additions to and retirements of equipment values to obtain end of year values. Capitalized leasehold improvements should be included on this line if the improvements are to leased equipment.

08) Construction in progress – Report capital assets under construction and not yet placed into service.

09) Other – Report all other amounts for capital assets not reported in lines 05-08.

10) Total property, plant, and Equipment – This calculated value is generated using this formula:

A10 = (A05 + . . . A09)

Part B – Summary of Changes in Equity

PLEASE COMPLETE PART A BEFORE PROVIDING DATA FOR PART B.

This part is intended to report a summary of changes in equity and to determine that all amounts being reported on the Balance Sheet Information (Part A), Revenues and Other Additions (Part D), and Expenses by Function (Part E) are in agreement.

01 – Total revenues and investment return - Enter all revenues that agree with the revenues recognized in your GPFS. The amount provided here is important because it will be carried forward to Part D.

02 – Total expenses - Enter all expenses that agree with the expenses recognized in your GPFS. The amount provided here is important because it will be carried forward to Part E.

03 – Sum of specific changes in equity - This calculated value is generated using this formula:



https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/public/survey-materials/forms?surveyid=5&instructionid=29012&formid=12 19/27

B03 = B04 –(B01 - B02)

The amount above should equal the sum of these amounts found in your GPFS:

a) Gains or (losses) on sale of plant assets;

b) Other nonoperating gains or (losses);

c) Provision for Federal and State income tax (where applicable);

d) Discontinued operations;

e) Extraordinary gain or (loss); and,

f) Cumulative effect of change(s) in accounting principle.

Because this is a calculated value, data providers are advised to compare this amount with the corresponding amount from their GPFS or underlying records. If these amounts differ materially, the data provider is advised to check the other amounts provided on this screen for data entry errors.

These terms are discussed below.

a) Gains or (losses) on sale of plant assets – Include the net gain or loss on the sale of plant, property and equipment reported in your GPFS.

b) Other nonoperating gains or (losses) – Include gains or losses recognized in your GPFS other than those reported previously.

06 – Equity, beginning of year - The amount reported on this line should correspond to the total equity at the beginning of the reporting period as found in your GPFS.

07 – Adjustments to beginning net equity - This calculated value is generated using this formula:

B07 = B08 – (B04 + B05 + B06)

Check your GPFS to make sure this generated amount is equal to the sum of any unrealized gains (losses) on investments and any other adjustments to beginning net equity not reported elsewhere. This includes adjustments for retroactive application of changes in accounting principle and prior period adjustments. If these amounts differ materially, the data provider is advised to check the other amounts provided on this screen for data entry errors.

08 – Equity, end of year - This amount is carried forward from the amount calculated in Part A, line 03. This amount should equal the total equity reported in your GPFS.

This section collects information about the sources of revenue that support (1) Scholarship and Fellowship expense and (2) discounts applied to tuition and fees and auxiliary enterprises.

For each source on lines 01-04, enter the amount of resources received from each source that are used for supporting scholarships and fellowships. Scholarships and fellowships include: grants-in-aid, trainee stipends, tuition and fee waivers, and prizes to students. Scholarships and fellowships do not include amounts provided to students as payments for services including teaching or research or as fringe benefits.

For lines 06 and 07, identify amounts that are reported in the GPFS as discounts and allowances only. “Discounts and allowance” means the institution displays the financial aid amount as a deduction from tuition and fees or a deduction from auxiliary enterprise revenues in its GPFS.

The allowance category is intended to be consistent with the definitions provided in the NACUBO Advisory Report on Accounting and Reporting Scholarship

Allowances to Tuition and Other Fee Revenues by Higher Education (AR 97-1, January 17,1997), which is available at the NACUBO website (www.nacubo.org). AR 97-1 states:

“A scholarship allowance is the difference between the stated charge for goods and services provided by the institution and the amount which is billed to students and/or third parties making payments on behalf of students. In considering what is or is not revenue, the following rule applies amounts received to satisfy student tuition and fees will be reported as revenues only once (e.g. student fees, gifts, investment income) and only amounts received from students and third-party payers to satisfy tuition and fees will be recognized as tuition and fees revenue."

For more information on reporting discounts and allowances in scholarships and fellowships, access the (IPEDS Tip Sheet).



Refer to these specific instructions for more information about reporting student grants.

01: Pell grants (federal) – Report the total amount of Pell Grants awarded to the institution for the fiscal year. Private institutions generally report Pell Grants as agency transactions.

04: Institutional grants – Enter the amount awarded to students from institutional resources.

05: Total revenue that funds scholarship and fellowships – This calculated value is the sum of lines 01 through 04. Because this is a calculated value, data providers are advised to check this amount with the corresponding amount on their GPFS or underlying records. If these amounts differ materially, the data provided is advised to check the other amounts provided on this screen for data entry errors.

06: Discounts and allowances applied to tuition and fees – Enter the amount of allowances (scholarships) applied to tuition and fees. The amount on this line, when added to the amount in Part D, line 01 equals gross tuition and fees. (FARM para. 460)

07: Discounts and allowances applied to auxiliary enterprise revenues - Enter the amount of allowances (scholarships) applied to auxiliary enterprise revenues (e.g., dormitory charges). The amount on this line, when added to the amount in Part D, line 07 equals gross auxiliary enterprise revenue. (FARM para. 460)

Part C-2: Sources of Discounts and Allowances

This part is intended to report details about sources of discounts and allowances.

For each source on lines 01 – 05, enter the amount of the scholarships and fellowships source applied to (1) tuition and fees discounts and allowances and (2) auxiliary enterprises discounts and allowances. The amount of the source applied to total discounts and allowances will be automatically calculated for you in the 3rd column.

If federal Pell and similar student aid grants are treated as agency transactions in your GPFS, they are excluded from this amount. If federal Pell and similar student aid grants are treated in your GPFS as student aid expenses or as allowances when awarded, include the grant revenue on this line and in Part E. (FARM para. 464) Include Higher Education Emergency Relief Act (HEERF) grants funded under the CARES, CRRSA, and ARP Acts. Do not include any ARRA revenues on this line (see line 08 in this part).

03a: State appropriations – Enter all amounts received from a state government through a direct appropriation of its legislative body, except state grants and contracts, which should be reported in line 03b.

Refer to the special instructions below.

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR CERTAIN HOSPITALS AND/OR MEDICAL CENTERS

Hospitals and/or medical centers reporting educational program activity that is operated by an entity for which the primary function is other than higher education should complete the IPEDS Finance Survey as follows:

a. Include in Part D the revenues directly associated with the educational programs offered. Combine the revenues of all educational programs offered.

b. Do not complete Part D, line 12 (Hospital revenue). This information is required only for hospitals whose financial activity is reported as a component of an institution of higher education.

c. Include in Part E all expenses associated with instruction and educational support services based on your underlying accounting records. Combine the expenses of all educational programs offered.



https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/public/survey-materials/forms?surveyid=5&instructionid=29012&formid=12 21/27

d. Complete Part A and Part B if the information for the educational program(s) component is obtainable from the underlying accounting records. Do not report information for the hospital as a whole.

08: Other revenue - This calculated value is generated using this formula:

D08 = D09 – (D01 + … + D07 + D12)

The amount above should be equal to corresponding amounts found in your GPFS. Excluded from this amount are gains or other unusual or nonrecurring items that are required to be included in Part B, such as gains on the sale of plant assets and extraordinary gains. If this generated amount is negative, this is an indication that amounts entered on this screen are not consistent with your audited GPFS or underlying records.

09: Total revenues and investment return - This amount is carried forward from Part B, line 01. Please check to make sure that the amount carried forward is the same as the amount found in your GPFS.

10: 12-month Student FTE from E12 – This number for full-time equivalent (FTE) student enrollment is carried over from the 12-month enrollment survey.

11: Total revenues and investment return per Student FTE – This amount is generated by dividing line 09 by line 10. This calculated value is used by the system to compare the data reported by the institution to the data of institutions that are in the same sector (e.g., public/private, 4-year/2-year) to see if the calculated value is an extreme value that is too high or low. While it is not anticipated that your institution would have the same overall revenues, this comparison may be useful for ensuring that all appropriate revenues have been included in the finance survey component, or excluded when appropriate.





Part E-1 – Expenses and Other Deductions: Functional Classification

PLEASE COMPLETE PART B BEFORE PROVIDING DATA FOR PART E.

Part E is intended to report expenses by function. All expenses recognized in the GPFS should be reported using the expense functions provided on lines 01–06, 10, and 11. These functional categories are consistent with Chapter 5 (Accounting for Independent Colleges and Universities) of the NACUBO FARM. (FARM para 504)

Institutions that do not have access to FARM can refer to Appendix B of the NACUBO Advisory Report 2010-1, Public Institutions: Methodologies for Allocating Depreciation, Operation and Maintenance of Plant, and Interest Expenses to Functional Expense Categories for more detailed information on the expense categories. Although this document was written for public institutions, the expenditure definitions are applicable to private institutions also. The advisory is

available online here.

Although for-profit institutions are not required to report expenses by functions in their GPFS, please report expenses by functional categories using your underlying accounting records. Expenses should be assigned to functional categories by direct identification with a function, wherever possible. When direct assignment to functional categories is not possible, an allocation is appropriate. Objective methods of allocating expense are preferable to subjective methods and may be based on financial or nonfinancial data.

The total for expenses on line 07 should agree with the total expenses reported in your GPFS including interest expense and any other non-operating expense.

Do not include losses or other unusual or nonrecurring items in Part E. (Special items including gains and losses should be reported in Part B.) Operation and maintenance of plant expenses are no longer reported as a separate functional expense category. Instead these expenses are to be distributed, or allocated, among the other functional expense categories.

Expenses by Functional Classification

Column 1, Total amount - Enter the total expense for each applicable functional category listed on lines 01–05, and 10. Total expenses, line 07, should agree with the total expenses reported in your GPFS.

Column 2, Salaries and wages – This column describes the natural classification of salary and wage expenses incurred in each functional category. For this classification, enter the amount of salary and wage expenses for the function identified in lines 01-05, 10, and 07. Do NOT include Operation and maintenance of plant (O&M) expenses in this category because O&M expenses are reported in a separate natural classification category.



Refer to these specific instructions for more information about reporting expenses.

01 – Instruction – Enter the instruction expenses of the colleges, schools, departments, and other instructional divisions of the institution and expenses for departmental research and public service that are not separately budgeted. The instruction category includes general academic instruction, occupational and vocational instruction, special session instruction, community education, preparatory, developmental and adult basic education, and tutorial instruction. Include expenses for both credit and non-credit activities. Exclude expenses for academic administration if the primary function is administration (e.g., academic deans). Such expenses should be entered on line 03a. (FARM para. 703.4)

02a – Research – Enter the expenses for activities specifically organized to produce research outcomes and either commissioned by an agency external to the institution or separately budgeted by an organizational unit within the institution. The category includes institutes and research centers, and individual and project research. Do not report nonresearch sponsored programs (e.g., training programs) on this line. Training programs generally are reported on line 01 (Instruction). (FARM para. 703.5)

02b – Public service – Enter the expenses specifically for public service and for activities established primarily to provide noninstructional services beneficial to groups external to the institution. Examples are seminars and projects provided to the particular sectors of the community. Include expenses for community services, cooperative extension services, and public broadcasting services. (FARM para. 703.6)

03a – Academic support – Enter the expenses for support services that are an integral part of the institution’s primary mission of instruction, research, or public service and that are not charged directly to these primary programs. Include expenses for libraries, museums, galleries, audio/visual services, academic administration, and formally organized and/or separately budgeted academic personnel development, academic computing support, course and curriculum development. Include expenses for medical, veterinary and dental clinics if their primary purpose is to support the institutional program, that is, they are not part of a hospital. (FARM para. 703.7)

03b – Student services – Enter the expenses for admissions, registrar activities and activities whose primary purpose is to contribute to students emotional and physical well-being and to their intellectual, cultural and social development outside the context of the formal instructional program. Examples are career guidance, counseling, financial aid administration, student records, athletics, and student health services, except when operated as a self-supporting auxiliary enterprise. (FARM para. 703.8)

03c – Institutional support – Enter the expenses for the day-to-day operational support of the institution. Include expenses for general administrative services, executive direction and planning, legal and fiscal operations, administrative computing support, and public relations/development. (FARM para. 703.9)

04 – Auxiliary enterprises – Enter expenses of essentially self-supporting operations of the institution that exist to furnish a service to students, faculty, or staff, and that charge a fee that is directly related to, although not necessarily equal to, the cost of the service. Examples are residence halls, food services, student health services, intercollegiate athletics (only if essentially self-supporting), college unions, college stores, faculty and staff parking, and faculty housing. (FARM para. 703.11)

05 – Net grant aid to students (net of tuition and fee allowances) - Enter on this line ONLY scholarships and fellowships recognized as expenses in your GPFS. Do not include Federal Work Study expenses on this line. Work study expenses should be reported within the function where the student worked. Whereas in the past, most student awards were recorded as expenses under this classification, most student awards are now reported as either scholarship allowances or agency transactions. Student awards, made from contributed funds or grant funds, that are under the control of the institution



https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/public/survey-materials/forms?surveyid=5&instructionid=29012&formid=12 22/27 (the institution decides who gets the award) result in allowances that reduce tuition or auxiliary enterprise revenue. Student awards, made from grant funds, that are made to students identified by the grantor are considered agency transactions and do not result in either revenues or expenses. Scholarships and fellowships in the form of allowances applied to tuition and fees should be reported in Part C, line 06, and not included in Part E, line 05. Scholarships and fellowships in the form of allowances applied to auxiliary services should be reported in Part C, line 07, and not included in Part E, line 05. (FARM para. 703.10)

According to NACUBO Advisory Report 97-1 (January 17, 1997), scholarships and fellowships are "expenses to the extent that the organization incurs incremental expense in providing goods and services." Thus payments made by the institution to students or third parties in support of the total cost of education are expenses if those payments are made for goods and services NOT provided by the institution. Examples include payments for services to third parties (including students) for off-campus housing or for the cost of board not provided by institutional contract meal plans.

10 – Hospital services (as applicable) – Enter all expenses associated with the operation of a hospital reported as a component of an institution of higher education. Include nursing expenses, other professional services, administrative services, fiscal services, and charges for operation and maintenance of plant. (FARM para. 703.12) Hospitals or medical centers reporting educational program activities conducted independent of an institution of higher education (not as a component of a reporting institution of higher education) should not complete this line. Refer to the special instructions below.

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR CERTAIN HOSPITALS AND/OR MEDICAL CENTERS Hospitals and/or medical centers reporting educational program activity operated by an entity for which the primary function is other than higher education should complete the IPEDS Finance Survey as follows:

a. Include in Part D the revenues directly associated with the educational programs offered. Combine the revenues of all educational programs offered.

b. Do not complete Part D, line 13 (Hospital revenue). This information is required only for hospitals whose financial activity is reported as a component of an institution of higher education.

c. Include in Part E all expenses associated with instruction and educational support services based on your underlying accounting records. Combine the expenses of all educational programs offered.

d. Complete Part A and Part B if the information for the educational program(s) component is obtainable from the underlying accounting records. Do not report information for the hospital as a whole.

06 - Other expenses and Deductions – This calculated value is generated using this formula:

E06 = E07 – (E01 + … + E10)

Because this is a generated number, data providers are advised to compare this amount with a corresponding amount in the institution's GPFS. If these amounts differ materially, the data provider is advised to check the other amounts provided on this screen for data entry errors.

07 – Total expenses and Deductions – This should be the same as the amount for total expenses found in your GPFS. Enter in columns 2, 3, 5, and 6 the total amount of each natural expense incurred by the institution. These amounts will be used to compute the amounts in line 06, as well as line 07





Part E-2 - Expenses and Other Deductions: Natural Classification

This part is intended to collect expenses by natural classification. Do NOT include Operation and maintenance of plant (O&M) expenses in Salaries and Wages, Benefits, Depreciation, Interest, or Other Natural Expenses because O&M expense is reported in its own separate natural classification category.

Expense by Natural Classification

07-2, Salaries and wages – This line is the total of salary and wage expenses incurred in all of the functional categories from the previous page. It has been carried over from Part E-1, Column 2 line 07.

07-3, Benefits - Enter the total amount of benefits expenses incurred.

07-4, Operation and Maintenance of Plant - This amount is used to show the distribution of operation and maintenance of plant expenses. Enter in this column the allocated amount of operation and maintenance of plant expenses for all functions listed on lines 01-06 in Part E-1.

07-5, Depreciation - Enter the total amount of depreciation incurred.

07-6, Interest - Enter in the total amount of interest incurred on debt.

07-7, All other Natural Expenses and deductions - This column will be calculated by the survey program as the difference between the total amount entered in 07-1 and the sum of 07-2 through 07-6. Please check the calculated amount for accuracy to determine that no keying errors have occurred.

07-1, Total expenses and Deductions - This amount is carried forward from Part E-1, line 07, and should agree with the total expenses reported in your GPFS.

08-1, 12-month Student FTE (from E12) – This number for full-time equivalent (FTE) student enrollment is carried over from the 12-month enrollment survey.

09-1, Total Expenses and Deductions per Student FTE - This amount is generated by dividing line 07-1 by line 08-1. This calculated value is used by the system to compare the data reported by the institution to the data of institutions that are in the same sector (e.g., public/private, 4-year/2-year) to see if the calculated value is an extreme value that is too high or low. While it is not anticipated that your institution would have the same overall expenses, this comparison may be useful for ensuring that all appropriate expenses have been included in the finance survey component, or excluded when appropriate.





Part G – Financial Health

This part is intended to collect the numerator and denominator used to calculate financial health ratios that compose the Composite Financial Index (CFI).



01 – Enter the amount of income/loss, prior to taxes, from the GPFS. Typically, this is the amount of total revenue minus operating expenses.

02 – The amount of total revenues recognized in the GPFS (reported as part B, line 01) has been carried forward from Part B.

03 – The institution’s total equity has been carried forward from Part A. This is calculated as the total assets minus total liabilities, (reported as part A, line 03).

04 – The institution’s total assets (reported as part A, line 01) has been carried forward from Part A.

05 – Enter the institution’s adjusted equity, which is calculated as total equity (part A, line 03) minus net property, plant & equipment (part A, line 01b) and intangible assets (part A, line 01c).

06 – Enter the institution’s debt related to property, plant, and equipment at par (i.e., face value or nominal value). Include the current and non-current portion of plant related debt that must be repaid (e.g., premiums, discounts, issuance costs, and asset retirement obligations are not included).

07 – The institution’s total expense has been carried forward from Part B, line 02.

Revenues received by an institution through acts of a legislative body, except grants and contracts. These funds are for meeting

Government appropriations
