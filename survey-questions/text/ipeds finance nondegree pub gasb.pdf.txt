Revenues and Other Additions

Expenses and Other Deductions

Scholarships and Fellowships

Sources of Discounts and Allowances

Census Information





Changes in Reporting

No changes for the 2024-25 data collection period.





General Instructions



Reporting Period Covered

The starting point for reporting should be amounts reported in the GPFS for the most recent fiscal year ending before October 1, 2024. For institutions with fiscal years ending on December 31, this would be the calendar year 2023.



About the Data

Data providers for this component should be familiar with college and university accounting policies and practices as described by the National Association of College and University Business Officers (NACUBO). To provide additional help, accounting terms are underlined and linked to definitions found in the online glossary.

Four different types of data appear in this component. There are data:

Institutions provide from their GPFS and/or underlying records.

That are prior year data, shown in red, which can be used as a comparison with the current year's data being reported. That are carried forward from one part of the component to another part to ensure that the data are internally consistent. Calculated from the other data elements.

In the latter two cases, the data provider is requested to check that the carried forward data and the calculated data are consistent with the data found in the institution's GPFS. If the data carried forward or calculated are not consistent with the institution's GPFS, then an error in data entry may have occurred.





https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/public/survey-materials/forms?surveyid=5&instructionid=30085&formid=85 19/30 Context Boxes

Context boxes are provided to allow institutions to provide more information regarding survey component items. Note that some context boxes are posted on

the College Navigator Website, which is the college search tool offered by NCES. NCES will review entries in these context boxes for applicability and

appropriateness before posting them on the College Navigator Website; institutions should check grammar and spelling of their entries.





Coverage



What to Include

The reporting entity's financial accounting policies and procedures should be the beginning basis for reporting to this IPEDS survey component. However, deviations from the GPFS may be required to respond to this IPEDS survey component. Some of these deviations include:

If financial categories in the institution’s GPFS are more aggregated than required for this IPEDS survey component, then use underlying institutional records to determine the necessary amounts.

If financial categories in the institution’s GPFS are more detailed than required, then combine the GPFS amounts and report only the combined number for this IPEDS survey component.

If amounts are reported in categories in the GPFS that differ from those required for the IPEDS survey, move those amounts to the IPEDS-requested categories.

Report all financial amounts in WHOLE DOLLARS only, omitting cents.

For any item on the survey component where exact data do not exist in the GPFS, please give estimates.



What NOT to Include

Do not report any projected amounts for future years. Do not make adjustments for prior-year corrections unless they are included as such corrections in the GPFS.

Detailed Instructions



This section provides line-by-line instructions for each Part of the Finance Component.

In the instructions, numbers found in parentheses at the end of each line provide additional reference to paragraphs in the National Association of College and Universities' Business Officers' (NACUBO) Financial Accounting and Reporting Manual (FARM). There are also some references to the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS).



Initial Login Screen

Check (click) the appropriate box to indicate the standards used to prepare the financial report data to be included on this IPEDS Finance Survey. If the institution's general purpose financial statements were prepared using GASB standards as revised by GASB Statement 34 and 35, mark the first option. The Finance Survey forms you will see will reflect the new standards.

If the institution uses FASB reporting standards (similar to private institutions), check the second option. The forms provided will reflect the terminology of FASB not-for-profit reporting standards.





General Information

Fiscal Year: Enter the beginning and ending dates of the period covered for the reported financial data.

Audit Opinion: Check the appropriate box to indicate if the GPFS received an unqualified opinion from your auditors. A "qualified opinion" occurs when the auditor includes exceptions to the opinion that "The financial statements present fairly, in all respects, the financial position as of (date) and the results of the operations for the year ended, in conformity with accounting standards generally accepted in the United States." When no such exceptions are included, the opinion is considered "unqualified." If "qualified" is checked, please note in the context box the nature of the qualification. If the statements have not been audited, please check "Don’t know" and note in the context box that the GPFS are unaudited.

Pension and Postemployment Benefit Other than Pension (OPEB): Indicate whether or not your institution includes liabilities, expenses, and/or deferrals for one or more defined benefit pension plans (either a single employer, agent employer or cost-sharing multiple employer) and/or one or more OPEB plans in its General Purpose Financial Statements for Fiscal Year 2024.

Note that if your institution fits any of the following criteria, you should respond "No":

•If your public institution does not have a defined pension benefit and/or OPEB plan

•If your public institution is part of a higher education system and the system reflects the pension and/or OPEB expense and liability (and does not allocate the expense and liability to the individual institutions)

•If your institution is a branch campus that did not have pension or OPEB expense and liabilities allocated to it

•If your institution is part of a special funding situation

For more information about reporting pension and GASB Statement 68 "Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions – an Amendment of GASB Statement

No. 27," please visit the GASB website. For more information about reporting OPEB and GASB Statement 75 "Accounting and Financial Reporting for

Postemployment Benefits Other than Pension," visit this site.

Note for institutions with jointly audited financial statements:

In the case where the system office absorbs all the pension and/or OPEB liabilities, expenses, and deferrals for the campuses; the system office should report “Yes” to the screening question(s) and the individual campuses will report "No". All institutions involved should note this reporting structure in the context box below the screening questions. Parts M-1 and M-2 will only be applicable to the system office.

In the case where the institution shares an audited financial statement with another entity (e.g., with district, high school, hospital), the institution should report only its proportionate share of the pension and/or OPEB expense, liability, and deferrals.





Part E-1 - Scholarships and Fellowships

This part is intended to report details about scholarships and fellowships.

For each source on lines 01–06, enter the amount of resources received that are used for scholarships and fellowships. Scholarships and fellowships include: grants-in-aid, trainee stipends, tuition and fee waivers, and prizes to students. Student grants do not include amounts provided to students as payments for teaching or research or as fringe benefits.

For lines 08 and 09, identify amounts that are reported in the GPFS as allowances only. "Discount and allowance" means the institution displays the financial aid amount as a deduction from tuition and fees or a deduction from auxiliary enterprise revenues in its GPFS. The allowance category is intended to be consistent with the definitions provided in the NACUBO Advisory Report Accounting and Reporting Scholarship Discounts and Allowances to Tuition and Other Fee Revenues by Public Institutions of Higher Education (AR 2000-05, September 1, 2000), which is available at

the NACUBO website (www.nacubo.org). AR 2000-05 states:

"A scholarship allowance is the difference between the stated charge for goods and services provided by the institution and the amount that is paid by students and/or third parties making payments on behalf of students. In considering what is or is not revenue (for Part D), the following rule applies: amounts received to satisfy student tuition and fees will be reported as revenue only once (e.g., student fees, gifts, federal grants and contracts such as Pell Grants, and investment income), and only amounts received from students and third-party payers to satisfy tuition and fees will be recognized as tuition and fee revenue."

For more information on reporting discounts and allowances in scholarships and fellowships, access the (IPEDS Tip Sheet).



Refer to these specific instructions for more information about reporting student scholarships and fellowships.

Line

05 – Institutional grants from restricted sources — Report amounts received for funding scholarships and fellowships received from private sources (e.g., businesses, foundations, individuals, foreign governments) that used restricted-expendable net assets of the institution. 06 – Institutional grants from unrestricted sources — This line is generated by taking the total on line 07 and subtracting the total of lines 01-05. This amount should include expenditures for scholarships and fellowships from unrestricted net assets of your institution. The institutional matching portion of federal, state or local grants should be reported here. Include athletic scholarships if appropriate.

07 – Total revenue that funds scholarships and fellowships — Report the total revenue used to fund scholarships and fellowships from sources in lines 01 to 06. Check this amount with the corresponding amount on their GPFS or underlying records.

This part is intended to report details about sources of discounts and allowances.

For each source on lines 01 – 05, enter the amount of the scholarships and fellowships source applied to (1) tuition and fees discounts and allowances and (2) auxiliary enterprises discounts and allowances. The amount of the source applied to total discounts and allowances will be automatically calculated for you in the 3rd column. Line 18 has been preloaded from data entered in Part E-1: Scholarships and Fellowships, line 08 for the 1st column "Tuition and fees discounts & allowances," line 09 for the 2nd column "Auxiliary enterprises discounts & allowances," and line 10 for the 3rd column "Total discounts & allowances."





Part B - Revenues and Other Additions, Page 1

This part is intended to report revenues by source.

The revenues and investment return reported in this part should agree with the revenues reported in the institution’s GPFS.

Includes all operating revenues, nonoperating revenues, and other additions for the reporting period. This includes unrestricted and restricted revenues and additions, whether expendable or nonexpendable.

Exclude from revenue (and expenses) interfund or intraorganizational charges and credits. Interfund and intraorganizational charges and credits include interdepartmental charges, indirect costs, and reclassifications from temporarily restricted net assets.

Operating revenues result from providing services and producing and delivering goods (see GASB Statement No. 9, paragraphs 16-19). Nonoperating revenues are those generated from non-exchange transactions, such as appropriations, gifts, and investment earnings. They are often used to support the operations of the institution. The term nonoperating does not preclude use for operating expenses.

In some cases an institution may report certain revenues in an operating or nonoperating category different from that shown on the IPEDS forms. This IPEDS component is not intended to dictate how an institution reports such revenues in its own GPFS. However, for consistency of reporting it is requested that information from the GPFS be reported to IPEDS as requested below.

For institutions receiving American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) revenues during the reporting period, report these amounts as part of line 19, Total nonoperating revenues. If the GPFS shows a separate amount for ARRA revenues in another revenue category (e.g., Federal operating grants and contracts) remove that amount from that other category for IPEDS reporting.

Refer to these specific instructions for more information about reporting revenues and investment return.

Operating Revenues

01 – Tuition & fees, after deducting discounts & allowances — Report all tuition & fees (including student activity fees) revenues received from students for education purposes.

Part B - Revenues and Other Additions, Page 2

Nonoperating revenues are those generated from non-exchange transactions, such as appropriations, gifts, and investment earnings. They are often used to support the operations of the institution. The term nonoperating does not preclude use for operating expenses.

Nonoperating Revenues

10 – Federal appropriations — Report all amounts received by the institution through acts of a federal legislative body, except grants and contracts. Funds reported in this category are for meeting current operating expenses, not for specific projects or programs. An example is federal land-grant appropriations.

Include all gifts or contributions to the institution except those classified as additions to permanent endowments or capital grants & gifts. Include gifts from affiliated organizations. Include the amount of contributed services recognized by the institution. Do not include on this line amounts subject to reporting on line 21.

17 – Investment income — Report on this line all investment income not reported on other lines.

18 – Other nonoperating revenues — This amount is generated by taking the total entered on line 19 and deducting the total of lines 10 through 17. A negative number may signify an error. Please check for keying errors and recheck totals. For institutions that received American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) revenues during the reporting period, allow these amounts to be reported through this calculated value by including the amount in line 19.

29 – Total operating and nonoperating revenues per Student FTE – This amount is generated by dividing line 27 by line 28. This calculated value is used by the system to compare the data reported by the institution to the data of institutions that are in the same sector (e.g., public/private, 4-year/2-year) to see if the calculated value is an extreme value that is too high or low. While it is not anticipated that your institution would have the same overall revenues, this comparison may be useful for ensuring that all appropriate revenues have been included in the finance survey component, or excluded when appropriate.





Part B - Revenues and Other Additions, Page 3

Other Revenues and Additions

24 – Total other revenues and additions — This generated amount should be the total of all revenue and additions included in the GPFS below the line on the Statement of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Net Assets for “income before other revenues, expenses, gains, and losses.” There may be more than one figure in your own GPFS and thus it may be necessary to combine the revenues and additions reported in this category such as capital appropriations, grants or contracts.

25 – Total all revenues and other additions — Report the total of all revenues, including operating, nonoperating, and other revenues and additions from the Statement of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Net Position. This amount should be the sum of the amounts from lines 09, 19, and 24.





Part C-1 - Expenses and Other Deductions: Functional Classification

This part is intended to collect expenses by function. All expenses recognized in the GPFS should be reported using the expense functions provided on lines 01– 19. These categories are consistent with NACUBO Advisory Report 2000-8, Recommended Disclosure of Alternative Expense Classification Information for Public Higher Education Institutions.

The total for expenses on line 19 should agree with the total expenses reported in your GPFS including interest expense and any other nonoperating expenses.

Include all operating expenses and nonoperating expenses and deductions. See GASB Statement No. 9, paragraphs 16-19, for an explanation of operating activities. Included are the costs incurred for salaries and wages, goods, and other services used in the conduct of the institution’s operations. Not included is the acquisition cost of capital assets, such as equipment and library books, to the extent the assets are capitalized under the institution’s capitalization policy.

Do not include losses or other unusual or nonrecurring items in Part C. (Special items including gains and losses should be accounted for in Part D.)



https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/public/survey-materials/forms?surveyid=5&instructionid=30085&formid=85 23/30 Operation and maintenance of plant is no longer reported as a separate functional expense category. Instead these expenses are to be distributed among the other functional expense categories. NACUBO has prepared guidance to assist GASB reporters make these allocations in Advisory Report 2010-1, Public Institutions: Methodologies for Allocating Depreciation, Operation and Maintenance of Plant, and Interest Expenses to Functional Expense Categories available

here.

The advisory report also has detailed definitions for the expense categories available in Appendix B for institutions that do not have access to the NACUBO FARM referenced in the instructions below.

As a result of the implementation of GASB Statement No. 68 and 75, "Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions" and "Accounting and Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits Other than Pensions (OPEB)," public institutions with defined pension and other postemployment benefit plans will be required to report an actuarially based pension and OPEB liability and related expenses and deferrals in their GPFS. The pension and OPEB expense that is recognized by GASB 68 and 75, as reported on the GPFS, should be allocated to Line 14-Other Functional Expenses and Deductions. Do not allocate these expenses across the functions.

Expense by Functional Classification

Column 1, Total amount - Enter the total expense for each applicable functional category listed on lines 01–10. Total expenses, line 19, should agree with the total expenses reported in your GPFS.

Column 2, Salaries & wages – This column describes the natural classification of salary and wage expenses incurred in each functional category. For this classification, enter the amount of salary and wage expenses for the function identified in lines 01-10 and 19. Do NOT include Operation and maintenance of plant (O&M) expenses in this category because O&M expenses are reported in a separate natural classification category.



Refer to these specific instructions for more information about reporting expenses.

01 – Instruction - Expenses of the colleges, schools, departments, and other instructional divisions of the institution and expenses for departmental research and public service that are not separately budgeted should be included in this classification. Include expenses for both credit and noncredit activities.

This is the amount that exceeds fees and charges assessed to students by the institution and that would not have been recorded as discounts & allowances. This classification will include the excess of awards over fees and charges from Pell Grants and other resources, including funds originally restricted for student assistance. Do not include loans to students or private awards where the institution is given custody of the funds but is not allowed to select the recipients; these are transactions recorded in balance sheet accounts and not revenues and expenses.

14 - Other functional expenses and deductions - This amount is generated by taking the total on line 19 and deducting the total of lines 01 through 10. Pension (Part M-1 – Line 01) and OPEB (Part M-2 – line 05) expenses as recognized by GASB 68 and 75 should be allocated to this category. 19 – Total Expenses & Deductions - Enter on this line totals that agree with the institution’s GPFS.





Part C-2 - Expenses and Other Deductions: Natural Classification

Term Definition



A functional expense category that includes expenses of activities and services that support the institution's primary missions of instruction, research, and public service. It includes the retention, preservation, and display of educational materials (for example, libraries, museums, and galleries); organized activities that provide support services to the academic functions of the institution (such as a demonstration school associated with a college of education or veterinary and dental clinics if their primary purpose is to support the instructional program); media such as audiovisual services; academic administration

Academic support (including academic deans but not department chairpersons); and formally organized and/or separately budgeted academic

personnel development and course and curriculum development expenses. Also included are information technology expenses related to academic support activities; if an institution does not separately budget and expense information technology resources, the costs associated with the three primary programs will be applied to this function and the remainder to institutional support. Institutions include actual or allocated costs for operation and maintenance of plant, interest, and depreciation.



An audit, performed by external (or outside) auditors, that usually consists of a one-page "opinion" letter on the general-purpose

financial statements. The "opinion" paragraph of the letter usually states that "In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position as of (date) and the results of operations for the year then ended, in

Audit opinion conformity with accounting standards generally accepted in the United States." If the auditor cannot state completely the

substance of the previous "opinion" sentence, then the auditor will add a phrase such as "...except for..." and state the basis for the exception. When the auditor includes exceptions to the opinion, the opinion is considered to be a "qualified opinion;" when no such exceptions are included, the opinion is considered to be an "unqualified opinion."



Revenues generated by or collected from the auxiliary enterprise operations of the institution that exist to furnish a service to students, faculty, or staff, and that charge a fee that is directly related to, although not necessarily equal to, the cost of the

Auxiliary enterprises revenues

A functional expense classification is a method of grouping expenses according to the purpose for which the costs are incurred.

Functional Expense

The classifications tell why an expense was incurred rather than what was purchased. (NACUBO FARM section 700)



Revenues received from gift or contribution nonexchange transactions. Includes bequests, promises to give (pledges), gifts from

an affiliated organization or a component unit not blended or consolidated, and income from funds held in irrevocable trusts or

Gifts distributable at the direction of the trustees of the trusts. Includes any contributed services recognized (recorded) by the

institution. FASB and GASB standards differ somewhat on when to recognize contributions or nonexchange revenues, with

FASB standards generally causing revenues to be recognized earlier in certain circumstances.



Revenues received by an institution through acts of a legislative body, except grants and contracts. These funds are for meeting

Government appropriations

current operating expenses and not for specific projects or programs. The most common example is a state's general

(revenues)

appropriation. Appropriations primarily to fund capital assets are classified as capital appropriations.



Revenues from governmental agencies and nongovernmental parties that are for specific research projects, other types of programs , or for general institutional operations (if not government appropriations). Examples are research projects, training programs, student financial assistance, and similar activities for which amounts are received or expenses are reimbursable

Grants and contracts under the terms of a grant or contract, including amounts to cover both direct and indirect expenses. Includes Pell Grants and (revenues) reimbursement for costs of administering federal financial aid programs. Grants and contracts should be classified to identify

The Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), conducted by the NCES, began in 1986 and involves annual

institution-level data collections. All postsecondary institutions that have a Program Participation Agreement with the Office of

Integrated Postsecondary Postsecondary Education (OPE), U.S. Department of Education (throughout IPEDS referred to as "Title IV") are required to report

Education Data System data using a web-based data collection system. IPEDS currently consists of the following components: Institutional

(IPEDS) Characteristics (IC); 12-month Enrollment (E12);Completions (C); Admissions (ADM); Student Financial Aid (SFA); Human

Resources (HR) composed of Employees by Assigned Position, Fall Staff, and Salaries; Fall Enrollment (EF); Graduation Rates

(GR); Outcome Measures (OM); Finance (F); and Academic Libraries (AL).

resources (sales taxes, gambling taxes, etc.).



Revenues from local government agencies that are for training programs and similar activities for which amounts are received or expenditures are reimbursable under the terms of a local government grant or contract. These amounts can be treated as an

Local government grants and

allowance, an agency transaction, or as a student aid expense in the institution's General Purpose Financial Statements

contracts (revenues)

(GPFS) and are reported differently depending on their treatment. Generally, however, private institutions report these grants

as allowances when applied to the student's account and as local grant revenues when received.

by GASB institutions.



GASB requires that revenues and expenses be separated between operating and nonoperating. Operating revenues and expenses result from providing goods and services. Nonoperating activities are those outside the activities that are part of the

operating activities of the institution. Most government appropriations are nonoperating because they are not generated by the

operations of the institution. Investment income is nonoperating in most instances because institutions are not engaged in

investing as an operating activity. Gifts are defined as nonoperating. Nonexchange transactions generate nonoperating revenues.
