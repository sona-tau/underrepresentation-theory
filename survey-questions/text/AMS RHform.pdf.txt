This survey asks you to provide information on FULL-TIME positions requiring a doctorate (tenure-track and non-tenure-track, including postdoctoral positions, instructors, lectures, etc.) that were under recruitment during the academic year 2018-2019 for employment beginning in the fall of 2019. The data you provide on this survey will allow us to publish a comprehensive picture of last year's academic job market in Mathematics.

You will be asked to report on positions under recruitment and on positions filled in two disjoint categories: tenure-track positions and non-tenure-track positions. Throughout this survey, the term "tenure-track position" includes positions that carry tenure with appointment to the position as well as any position where an appointment carries eligibility to earn tenure.
