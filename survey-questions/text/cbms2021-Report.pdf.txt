department. In 1995 and 2000, only those computer science courses taught in the mathematics department were included. Starting in 2005,

no computer science courses were included in the two-year mathematics survey, and starting in 2010, no computer science courses were

Data beginning in 2005 include only public two-year colleges.



Note: Before 1995, two-year enrollment totals included computer science enrollments taught outside of the mathematics program. In 1995

and 2000, only computer science courses taught within the mathematics department of two-year colleges were counted. Starting in 2005, no

computer science courses were included in the CBMS survey of two-year mathematics programs, and starting in 2010, no computer science

data were included in the survey of statistics departments.

1 Beginning in 2010, the CBMS survey added the word “permanent” to the description “tenured/tenure eligible” that was used previously. In

2015, the word “permanent” was deleted.



2 In previous CBMS surveys, this course was called “Elementary Statistics.”



3 E1 is the statistics course number on the four-year statistics survey form.



4 Previous CBMS surveys gathered data for a course described as Probability and Statistics (no calculus prerequisite). Beginning in 2010, this

description was replaced with Introductory Statistics (calculus prerequisite) (for non-majors).



Sums of percentages across rows may differ from 100% due to round-off.

(e.g., by a school district for a dual-enrollment course). In 2005, the number paid by a third party was 1915; in 2010, the number paid by a

third party was 2323; and in 2015, the number paid by a third party was 2359.

the two questions on CBMS 2015 are combined, then 63 percent of total mathematics departments responded that they had a program for

certification for K–5 and/or 6–8 teachers.

1 A postdoctoral appointment is a temporary position primarily intended to provide an opportunity to extend graduate training or to fur-

ther research experience. Postdoctoral faculty are included in the other full-time faculty totals throughout CBMS2010. This contrasts with

publications of the AMS-ASA-IMS-MAA-SIAM Annual Survey since 2003, which list postdoctoral faculty as a category separate from other

full-time faculty. Before 2003, separate counts of postdoctoral faculty were not collected by the Annual Survey.

the survey consists of six multiple-choice questions, a

available, broken down by department type, highest

degree offered, institutional size, and institutional

control (public/private).



In this report, the headings generally indicate take-away

messages from the responses, and they generally follow

the sequence of the survey instrument questions.

Within the headings, the discussion, figures, and tables

summarize or highlight the authors’ findings.

Information about methodology, response rates, and

other statistical matters appear in the appendices along

with tables giving fuller breakdowns on responses. NOTE: Department chairs could choose more than one response.

Percentages may add to more than 100.

combining the two categories of “almost all” and

“more than half of courses”, the format “only

online synchronous” was the most frequently

used option (50%), followed by “a mixture of

online and face-to-face sessions” (26%; Figure 1).

• “Only online and asynchronous” and “only online

synchronous” together accounted for the

responses from 53% of the mathematics

departments at four-year institutions, 77% of the

statistics departments, and 76% of the

mathematics departments at two-year colleges.

• The least used format in all the departments

combined was “only face-to-face” (10%).

• There was more frequent use of the “only online

228 2021 CBMS Survey of Undergraduate Programs



General Information Four-Year College Mathematics Questionnaire



As part of a random sample, your department has been chosen to participate in the NSF-funded CBMS2021 National Survey of Undergraduate Mathematical Sciences Programs. The presidents of all U.S. mathematical sciences organizations have endorsed it and ask for your cooperation.

We assure you that no individual departmental data, except the names of responding departments, will be released.



This survey provides data about the nation's undergraduate mathematical and statistical effort that is available from no other source. You can see the results of a similar survey fielded six years ago by going to www.ams.org/cbms, where the CBMS 2015 report is available online.



All departments in this survey are in universities and colleges that offer at least a bachelor’s degree. They may or may not offer a major in mathematics. Many of the departments in our random sample also offer higher degrees in mathematical sciences.



We have classified your department as belonging to a university or four-year college. If this is not correct, please contact Ellen Kirkman, Survey Director, at 336-758-5351 or at Kirkman@wfu.edu.



Please report on undergraduate programs in the broadly defined mathematical sciences (including applied mathematics, statistics, operations research, and computer science) that are under the direction of your department. Do not include data for other departments or for branches or campuses of your institution that are budgetarily separate from your own. Also, if your department is broader than just mathematics (e.g., Division of Mathematics and Sciences), please report only on the mathematics courses (as broadly defined here).



This survey may be completed either online or using a hard-copy questionnaire. We recommend using the online system because it will do some of the work for you; e.g., it will automatically skip those questions that are not applicable (based on the response you give), gray out portions of questions that do not apply, remind you of previous responses, and provide definitions when you let your cursor hover over certain highlighted words.



If you have any questions while filling out this survey form, please call the Survey Director, Ellen Kirkman, at 336-758-5351 or contact her by e-mail at Kirkman@wfu.edu. For help with the online questionnaire, call Westat at 855-770-0558 or send an email to cbms2021@westat.com.



Please complete the questionnaire by October 29, 2021 online or by mailing a hard copy to:

E. Mathematics Courses (Fall 2021) (cont.) Four-Year Mathematics Questionnaire



In the next several pages you will enter data about courses your department is teaching. For each course that is taught, you will be asked to enter the fall 2021 enrollment and the number of sections of the course. Depending upon what you indicated above, you will be asked about distance/remote learning enrollment.



The following instructions apply throughout Sections E (mathematics courses), F (statistics courses), and G (computer science courses) (pages 12-23).



• Do NOT include any dual enrollment sections or enrollments in these tables. (In this

questionnaire, a dual enrollment section is one that is conducted in a high school, taught by a high school teacher, and allows students to receive high school credit and, simultaneously, college credit from your institution for the course. These courses were reported in Section B. Include courses taught at high schools by college faculty)

• Column (a): Report distance/remote learning enrollments separately from other

enrollments. Distance/remote learning courses are those courses offered by your institution for credit, in which more than half of the instruction occurs with the instructor and the students separated by time and /or place, facilitated by technology (e.g. courses in which more than half of the course is taught online synchronously or asynchronously, or by computer software, or by other technologies).

• Columns (c) and (d) for Calculus and Introductory Statistics classes. You will be asked to

list separately classes taught in a large lecture format (with recitation/problem/laboratory sections) and sections that meet as a class with an instructor at a regularly scheduled time (and are not divided into recitation sections). For example, for Mainstream Calculus I, you will be asked for both the number of large lecture courses (E13-1 column (c)) and the total number of recitation sections for all the large lectures (E13-1 column (d)). Please treat any large class that is sometimes broken up into smaller units as a “lecture/recitation” class (even if there is no lecture); if neither the lecture/recitation or individual class format seems an appropriate description of the enrollment, enter the enrollment under “other”.

• Courses, sections, and sessions. In this questionnaire, “course” is used to refer to the

topic area (e.g., Calculus 1 or Number Theory). You may have multiple faculty teaching the same course in the same term but at different times or locations; these divisions of the topic area into separate instances of teaching are called sections. Within a section, you may have times when the students are divided into laboratory or recitation sessions; these are counted as recitation sessions, not as separate sections.

• For all courses except as marked in E13, E14, E15, E16, F1, and F2, please do not treat

recitation sessions as separate sections. Instead, please treat both the lecture component and any associated recitation sessions as a single section.

• Do not fill in any shaded boxes.

• Any unshaded box that is left blank will be interpreted as reporting a count of zero. • Except where specifically stated to the contrary, the tables in Sections E, F, and G deal with

enrollments in fall term 2021.

• If an undergraduate course contains a mixture of graduate and undergraduate students,

report them all in column (b).

Full-time faculty teaching in your department and holding joint appointments with other departments should be counted in column (b) if they are tenured, tenure-eligible, or permanent (if your institution does not recognize tenure) in your department. Faculty who are not tenured, tenure-eligible, or permanent in your department should be counted in column (d) if their fall 2021 teaching in your department is less than or equal to 50% of their total fall teaching assignment, and they should be reported in column (c) otherwise. (Example: If a tenured physics professor with a joint appointment in your department teaches a total of two courses in fall 2021, with exactly one being in your department and hence mathematics comprised 50% of the fall teaching assignment, then that person would be counted as parttime in your department.) 2 Report a section of a course as being taught by a graduate teaching assistant (GTA) if and only if that section is taught independently by the GTA, i.e., when it is the GTA's own course and the GTA is the instructor of record.

F25. Please enter the total fall 2021 enrollments, number of sections, and recitation sections below,

as indicated.



Instructions



• Do NOT include any dual enrollment sections or enrollments in these tables. (In this

questionnaire, a dual enrollment section is one that is conducted in a high school, taught by a high school teacher, and allows students to receive high school credit and, simultaneously, college credit from your institution for the course. These courses were reported in Section B. Include courses taught at high schools by college faculty)

• Column (a): Report distance/remote learning enrollments separately from other

enrollments. Distance/remote learning courses are those courses offered by your institution for credit, in which more than half of the instruction occurs with the instructor and the students separated by time and /or place, facilitated by technology (e.g. courses in which more than half of the course is taught online synchronously or asynchronously, or by computer software, or by other technologies).

• Columns (c) and (d) for Calculus and Introductory Statistics classes. You will be asked to

list separately classes taught in a large lecture format (with recitation/problem/laboratory sections) and sections that meet as a class with an instructor at a regularly scheduled time (and are not divided into recitation sections). For example, for Introductory Statistics, you will be asked for both the number of large lecture courses (F1-1 column (c)) and the total number of recitation sections for all the large lectures (F1-1 column (d)). Please treat any large class that is sometimes broken up into smaller units as a “lecture/recitation” class (even if there is no lecture); if neither the lecture/recitation or individual class format seems an appropriate description of the enrollment, enter the enrollment under “other”.

• Courses, sections, and sessions. In this questionnaire, “course” is used to refer to the

topic area (e.g., Calculus 1 or Number Theory). You may have multiple faculty teaching the same course in the same term but at different times or locations; these divisions of the topic area into separate instances of teaching are called sections. Within a section, you may have times when the students are divided into laboratory or recitation sessions; these are counted as recitation sessions, not as separate sections.

• For all courses except as marked in F1 and F2, please do not treat recitation sessions as

separate sections. Instead, please treat both the lecture component and any associated recitation sessions as a single section.

• Do not fill in any shaded boxes.

• Any unshaded box that is left blank will be interpreted as reporting a count of zero. • Except where specifically stated to the contrary, the tables in Sections E, F, and G deal with

enrollments in fall term 2021.

• If an undergraduate course contains a mixture of graduate and undergraduate students,

report them all in column (b).

276 2021 CBMS Survey of Undergraduate Programs



General Information Two-Year College Mathematics Questionnaire



As part of a random sample, your department has been selected to participate in the CBMS 2021 National Survey, the importance of which has been endorsed by all of our major professional societies. Please read the instructions in each section carefully and complete all of the pertinent item s as indicated.



If your college does not have a departmental or divisional structure, consider the group of all mathematics instructors to be the “mathematics department” for the purpose of this survey.



If you belong to a multi-campus system, please report for the entire multi-campus system to which you belong. If it is not appropriate to report for the entire system (i.e., because at least one campus directly administers its own program), please call Westat at 1-855-770-0558.



This questionnaire should be completed by the person who is directly in charge of the mathematics program or department on your cam pus. It may be that a different person, such as the college Registrar or a person in Institutional Research, is best equipped to answer Section F on course enrollment; we provide a method for delegating that section to another person in case that will help you. Please contact Westat at 855-770-0558 or send an email to cbms2021@westat.com if you would like to delegate a section to another person.



Report on all of your courses and instructors that fall under the general heading of the mathematics program or department. Include all mathematics and statistics courses taught within your mathematics program or department.



We have classified your department as belonging to a two-year college, to a college or campus within a two-year system, or to a two-year branch of a university system. If this is not correct, please contact Richelle (Rikki) Blair at the email address or telephone number given below.



We recommend completing this questionnaire online because the online system will automatically skip those questions that are not applicable to you (based on the responses you give). However, this survey may be completed using a hard-copy questionnaire.



If you have any questions, please contact Richelle (Rikki) Blair, Associate Director for Two- Year Colleges, by email at richelle.blair@sbcglobal.net or by phone at 440-212-5965. For help with the online questionnaire, call Westat at 855-770-0558 or send an email to cbms2021@westat.com.



Please return your completed questionnaire by October 29, 2021, either online or by mailing a hard copy to:

308 2021 CBMS Survey of Undergraduate Programs



General Information Statistics Questionnaire-



As part of a random sample, your department has been chosen to participate in the NSF-funded CBMS2021 National Survey of Undergraduate Mathematical Sciences Programs. The presidents of all U.S. mathematical sciences organizations have endorsed it and ask for your cooperation. We assure you that no individual departmental data, except the names of responding departments, will be released.



This survey provides data about the nation's undergraduate mathematical and statistical effort that is available from no other source. You can see the results of a similar survey fielded six years ago by going to www.ams.org/cbms, where the CBMS 2015 report is available online.



All departments in this survey are in universities and colleges that offer at least a bachelor’s degree. They may or may not offer an undergraduate major in statistics. Most of the statistics departments in our random sample also offer higher degrees in statistical sciences.



We have classified your department as belonging to a university or four-year college. If this is not correct, please contact Ellen Kirkman, Survey Director, at 336-758-5351 or at Kirkman@wfu.edu.



Please report on undergraduate programs in the statistical sciences (including probability) that are under the direction of your department. Do not include data for other departments or for branches or campuses of your institution that are budgetarily separate from your own. Also, if your department is broader than just statistics (e.g., Department of Statistics and Computer Science or Statistics and Operations Research), please report on all the courses offered by your department.



This survey may be completed either online or using a hard-copy questionnaire. We recommend using the online system because it will do some of the work for you; e.g., it will automatically skip those questions that are not applicable (based on the response you give), gray out portions of questions that do not apply, remind you of previous responses, and provide definitions when you let your cursor hover over certain highlighted words.



If you have any questions while filling out this survey form, please call the Survey Director, Ellen Kirkman, at 336-758-5351 or contact her by e-mail at Kirkman@wfu.edu. For help with the online questionnaire, call Westat at 855-770-0558 or send an email to cbms2021@westat.com.



Please complete the questionnaire by October 29, 2021 online or by mailing a hard copy to:

E. Probability and Statistics Courses (Fall 2021) Statistics Questionnaire



Which of the following courses are taught in your department in Fall 2021? You may use different titles for these courses, and may have multiple courses that match a particular course name.



• Enter an X in each applicable box.

• Do not include courses taught in other departments, learning centers, or developmental/remedial

programs separate from your statistics program or department.

• Please also indicate which catalog codes are used to identify those courses taught in Fall 2021.

This information will be used to generate a reduced course list suitable for your department so reporting on enrollments will be easier.

• Make sure that no course is reported in more than one row. • If your department is broader than just statistics (e.g., Department of Statistics and Computer

Science or Statistics and Operations Research), please use E24 to report on the courses outside of probability and statistics.

• Introductory Statistics classes. You will be asked to list separately Introductory Statistics classes

taught in a large lecture format (with recitation/problem/laboratory sections) and, sections that meet as a class with an instructor at a regularly scheduled time (and are not divided into recitation sections). For example, you will be asked about large lecture courses (E1-1 column). Please treat any large class that is sometimes broken up into smaller units as a “lecture/recitation” class (even if there is no lecture); if neither the lecture/recitation or individual class format seems an appropriate de scription of the enrollment, enter the enrollment under “other.”

Appendix VIII. Four-Year Statistics Questionnaire 319



E. Probability and Statistics Courses (Fall 2021) Statistics Questionnaire



In the next several pages you will enter data about courses your department is teaching. For each course that is taught, you will be asked to enter the fall 2021 enrollment and the number of sections of the course. Depending upon what you indicated above, you will be asked about distance/ remote learning enrollment.



The following instructions apply throughout Section E (pages 10-12).



• Courses, sections, and sessions. In this questionnaire, “course” is used to refer to the topic

area (e.g., Stochastic Processes or Biostatistics). You may have multiple faculty teaching the same course in the same term but at different times or locations; these divisions of the topic area into separate instances of teaching are called sections. Within a section, you may have times when the students are divided into laboratory or recitation sessions; these are counted as recitation sessions, not as separate sections.

• Below please do not treat recitation sessions as separate sections. Instead, please treat both

the lecture component and any associated recitation sessions as a single section.

• If a course is cross-listed in both statistics and another department (such as mathematics,

psychology, or engineering), count all students, regardless of how the course is listed on the students’ transcripts.

• Do not fill in any shaded boxes.

• Any unshaded box that is left blank will be interpreted as reporting a count of zero. • Except where specifically stated to the contrary, the tables in Section E deal with enrollments

in fall term 2021.

If your institution does recognize tenure but has faculty with renewable contracts, report these faculty as other full-time faculty (column c). Full-time faculty teaching in your department and holding joint appointments with other departments should be counted in column (b) if they are tenured, tenure-eligible, or permanent (if your institution does not recognize tenure) in your department. Faculty who are not tenured, tenure-eligible, or permanent in your department should be counted in column (d) if their fall 2021 teaching in your department is less than or equal to 50% of their total fall teaching assignment, and they should be reported in column (c) otherwise. (Example: If a tenured computer science professor with a joint appointment in your department teaches a total of two courses in fall 2021, with exactly one being in your department and hence statistics comprised 50% of the fall teaching assignment, then that person would be counted as parttime in your department.)

2 Report a section of a course as being taught by a graduate teaching assistant (GTA) if and only if that section is taught independently by the GTA, i.e., when it is the GTA's own course and the GTA is the instructor of record.
