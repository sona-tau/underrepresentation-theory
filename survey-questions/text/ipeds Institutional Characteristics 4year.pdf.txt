What award levels are offered by your institution? [Check all that apply]

Award Levels reported should be completed based on the current year. When reporting award levels for subbaccalaureate certificates (levels 1a, 1b, 2, and 4), determine program length by the number of credit or clock hours.

The "Other" award level should not be used unless your program truly does not fit any of the other award levels. We expect very few institutions to fit the "Other" category.

Even though Teacher Preparation certificate programs may require a bachelor's degree for admission, they are considered subbaccalaureate undergraduate programs. Check the applicable award level 1a, 1b, 2, or 4, depending on the length of the Teacher Preparation program.
