NOTE: The above data are based on the Salary Outlays part of the IPEDS HR component. The Weighted average monthly salaries of full-time instructional staff by academic rank are calculated by adding the salary outlays reported for Men plus Women by academic rank, then dividing the sum by the "Total Number of Months" for Men plus Women by academic rank. Salaries of full-time instructional staff paid less than 9 months per year are not collected. Also, salaries of medical school staff are not collected. The weighted average monthly salaries may be included in the DFR.
