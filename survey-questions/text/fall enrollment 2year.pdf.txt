Fall Enrollment for 2-year degree-granting institutions

Overview

Fall Enrollment Overview

The Fall Enrollment component collects student enrollment counts by level of student, enrollment status, gender and race/ethnicity. In addition, first-time students’ fall-to-fall retention rates and the student-to-faculty ratio are collected. Enrollment by age is required in odd-numbered years, and enrollment by residence of first-time undergraduates is required in even-numbered years.

Institutions operating on a traditional academic year calendar (semester, trimester, quarter, or 4-1-4) report Fall enrollment as of the institution's official fall reporting date or October 15. Institutions operating on a calendar that differs by program or that enrolls students on a continuous basis (referred to as program reporters) report Fall enrollment as students enrolled any time during the period August 1 and October 31.

Data reporting reminders:

Report data to accurately reflect the time period corresponding with the IPEDS survey component, even if such reporting is seemingly inconsistent with prior year reporting.

Part B, Enrollment of students by age, is optional this year.

Part C, Residence of first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates, is required this year.

For reporting students studying in consortium agreements, please refer to the Resource page at https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/report-your-data/data-tip-sheet-

reporting-data-consortium-institutions.

Changes in reporting:

The following changes were implemented for the 2024-25 data collection period:

Added note to Instructions for Part D: Total Undergraduate Entering Class to indicate that high school students enrolled in college courses for credit should not be included in any calculations to determine an institution’s entering class. [Applicable to degree-granting institutions only] Added a new FAQ to better clarify the relationship between “transfer-in” enrollment status on the Fall Enrollment (EF) and 12-month Enrollment (E12) components and the “non-first-time” cohort on the Outcome Measures (OM) component.

Revised definition for “Transfer-in student” Glossary term to improve clarity.

Revised definition for “Non-first-time student (undergraduate)” Glossary term to improve clarity. Revised definition for “Continuing/Returning student (undergraduate)” Glossary term to improve clarity. Revised definition for “Entering students (undergraduate)” Glossary term to improve clarity.

https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/public/survey-materials/forms?surveyid=6&instructionid=30077&formid=77 5/30 Part A - Fall Enrollment- Gender Unknown or Another Gender than Provided Categories

Reporting Reminders:

The purpose of this supplemental section is to determine whether institutions are able to report the number of students for whom gender is unknown and the

number of students for whom gender does not align with the 'Men' and 'Women' categories. Note that these students must still be allocated into the 'Men' and

'Women' categories in all other sections of the survey component.

Institutions should not ask students that do not select a binary gender to allocate themselves to a binary gender category; it is up to the institution to allocate

unknown students and students that indicate another gender into the binary categories throughout the forms where required. One method commonly used by

institutions is to allocate these students to the binary categories required in other parts of the form using the proportion of men to women reported.

The 'gender unknown' category is to report students for whom the institution does not know a gender.

Is your institution able to report another gender for the Fall 2024 reporting period?

If you indicate 'No, my institution is not able to report another gender,' leave the cells in the rows for 'Another gender' blank (i.e., do not report 0). If you indicate 'No, some cells will have a value of less than 5 students,' your institution collects data on another gender, but some cells have a value of less than 5 students, do not report the data and leave the cells in the rows for 'Another gender' blank. If you indicate 'Yes', but no students identified as another gender, please enter '0'.

Undergraduate students:

No, my institution is not able to report another gender (do not report)

No, some cells will have a value of less than 5 students (do not report)

Yes



Of the total students reported, how many students did you allocate to a binary gender category (Men/Women) because their gender was unknown or another gender than the provided categories?

Retention Rates - Full-time, First-time degree/certificate-seeking Cohort from Fall 2023




Academic reporters report retention data as of the institution's official fall reporting date or as of October 15. Program reporters determine the cohort with enrollment any time between August 1 and October 31, 2023 and retention based on August 1, 2024.

The retention rate is calculated by the system after clicking "Save" on the screen. Exclusions are subtracted from the original cohort and the resulting adjusted cohort is used for calculating the retention rate.

Retention Data Reporting Reminders:

Include only full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking students in this cohort.

Determine full-time using Fall 2023 attendance status (e.g., if a student was full-time in Fall 2023, report them in the full-time cohort regardless of Fall 2024

status).

If there are no students to report in the cohort, enter zero. Do not leave the field blank.

Report in the exclusions box (line E2a) the number of students from the cohort who left the institution for any of the following reasons: died or were totally

and permanently disabled; to serve in the armed forces (including those called to active duty); to serve with a foreign aid service of the Federal Government

(e.g., Peace Corps); or to serve on official church missions.

Report in the inclusion box (line E2b) first-time degree/certificate-seeking study abroad students who were excluded from the first-time cohort (line E1) but

who have re-enrolled at the institution their second year.

Retention Rates - Part-time, First-time degree/certificate-seeking Cohort from Fall 2023




Academic reporters report retention data as of the institution's official fall reporting date or as of October 15. Program reporters determine the cohort with enrollment any time between August 1 and October 31, 2023 and retention based on August 1, 2024.

The retention rate is calculated by the system after clicking "Save" on the screen. Exclusions are subtracted from the original cohort and the resulting adjusted cohort is used for calculating the retention rate.

Retention Data Reporting Reminders:

Include only part-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking students in this cohort. Determine part-time using Fall 2023 attendance status (e.g., if a student was part-time in Fall 2023, report them in the part-time cohort regardless of their Fall 2024 status).

If there are no students to report in the cohort, enter zero. Do not leave the field blank.

Report in the exclusions box (line E7a) the number of students from the cohort who left the institution for any of the following reasons: died or were totally and permanently disabled; to serve in the armed forces (including those called to active duty); to serve with a foreign aid service of the Federal Government (e.g., Peace Corps); or to serve on official church missions.

Reporting Individuals by Racial/Ethnic Categories

Part A: Fall Enrollment by Level, Attendance Status, Race/Ethnicity, and Gender

Part B: Fall Enrollment by Age

Part C: Residence of First-Time Degree/Certificate-Seeking Undergraduates

Part E: Retention Rates for First-Time Degree/Certificate-Seeking Undergraduates

Part F: Student-to-Faculty Ratio



Purpose of Survey

The purpose of the Fall Enrollment component of IPEDS is to collect enrollment data on all students enrolled for credit in courses/programs that could lead to awards ranging from postsecondary certificates of less than 1 year to doctoral degrees. Fall enrollment data are collected by level of student, attendance status, race/ethnicity, and gender. In addition, the Fall Enrollment component collects data on the institution's undergraduate entering class, first-time students’ fall-to-fall retention rates, and the student-to-faculty ratio. In even-numbered years, data on enrollment by nine selected fields of study are collected, as is residency of first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students. In odd-numbered years, enrollment by student age is collected.

Data reporting reminders:

Report data to accurately reflect the time period corresponding with the IPEDS survey component, even if such reporting is seemingly inconsistent with prior year reporting.

Part B, Enrollment of students by age, is optional this year.

Part C, Residence of first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates, is required this year.

For reporting students studying in consortium agreements, please refer to the Resource page at https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/report-your-data/data-tip-

sheet-reporting-data-consortium-institutions.





Changes in reporting

The following changes were implemented for the 2024-25 data collection period:

Added note to Instructions for Part D: Total Undergraduate Entering Class to indicate that high school students enrolled in college courses for credit should not be included in any calculations to determine an institution’s entering class. [Applicable to degree-granting institutions only] Added a new FAQ to better clarify the relationship between "transfer-in" enrollment status on the Fall Enrollment (EF) and 12-month Enrollment (E12) components and the "non-first-time" cohort on the Outcome Measures (OM) component.

Revised definition for "Transfer-in student" Glossary term to improve clarity.

Revised definition for "Non-first-time student (undergraduate)" Glossary term to improve clarity. Revised definition for "Continuing/Returning student (undergraduate)" Glossary term to improve clarity. Revised definition for "Entering students (undergraduate)" Glossary term to improve clarity.





General Instructions



Reporting Period Covered

For institutions operating on a traditional academic year calendar (semester, trimester, quarter, or 4-1-4), fall enrollment should be reported as of the institution's official fall reporting date or October 15.



https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/public/survey-materials/forms?surveyid=6&instructionid=30077&formid=77 22/30

For institutions operating on an "other academic calendar," a calendar that differs by program, or enrolls students on a continuous basis (referred to as program reporters), fall enrollment is reported for students enrolled any time during the period August 1 and October 31.





Context Boxes

Context boxes are provided to allow institutions to provide more information regarding survey component items. Note that some context boxes are posted on

the College Navigator Website, which is the college search tool offered by NCES. NCES will review entries in these context boxes for applicability and

appropriateness before posting them on the College Navigator Website; institutions should check grammar and spelling of their entries.

Reporting Persons by Racial/Ethnic Category (1997 OMB)

This information is being collected in compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and Sec. 421(a) (1) of the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act. These instructions correspond with the Final Guidance on Maintaining, Collecting, and Reporting Racial and Ethnic Data to the U.S. Department of Education, published in the Federal Register on October 19, 2007.

Method of collection - Institutions must collect race and ethnicity information using a 2-question format. The first question is whether the respondent is Hispanic/Latino. The second question is whether the respondent is from one or more races from the following list: American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and White. Institutions should allow students and staff to self-identify their race and ethnicity. For further details on the guidance for collecting these data, please see the full Federal Register notice. Method of reporting aggregate data - Institutions must report aggregate data to the U.S. Department of Education using the NINE categories below. Racial/ethnic designations are requested only for United States citizens, residents, and other eligible non-citizens. Eligible noncitizens include all students who completed high school or a GED equivalency within the United States (including DACA and undocumented students) and who were not on an F-1 non-immigrant student visa at the time of high school graduation. More information about other eligible (for financial aid purposes) non-citizens is available at

https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/eligibility/requirements/non-us-citizens.

Hispanic or Latino, regardless of race

For Non-Hispanic/Latino individuals:

American Indian or Alaska Native

Asian

Black or African American

Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander

White

Two or more races

In addition, the following categories may be used:

U.S. Nonresident

Race and ethnicity unknown

Racial/ethnic descriptions - Racial/ethnic designations as used in this survey do not denote scientific definitions of anthropological origins. The categories are:

Hispanic or Latino- A person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race. American Indian or Alaska Native- A person having origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America) who maintains cultural identification through tribal affiliation or community attachment.

Asian- A person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian Subcontinent, including, for example, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam. Black or African American- A person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa. Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander- A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands. White - A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa.

Other descriptive categories

U.S. Nonresident - A person who is not a citizen or national of the United States and who is in this country on a visa or temporary basis and does not have the right to remain indefinitely. Do not include DACA, undocumented, or other eligible noncitizens in this category. NOTE - U.S. Nonresidents are to be reported separately, in the boxes provided, rather than included in any of the seven racial/ethnic categories. Race and ethnicity unknown - This category is used only if the person did not select EITHER a racial or ethnic designation.





Part A: Full-Time Undergraduate Students by Race/Ethnicity and Gender On this screen, include all students enrolled for credit, full-time at the undergraduate level. The undergraduate level includes students enrolled in undergraduate level courses, in 4 or 5-year bachelor's degree programs, associate's degree programs, or any certificate programs below the baccalaureate level. Students who have already earned a bachelor's degree but are taking undergraduate courses for credit should be included as undergraduates.

Full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students

In column 1, report undergraduate students who have no prior postsecondary experience and have enrolled full-time with the intent to earn a

degree, certificate, or other recognized postsecondary credential. The following are also considered first-time:

Students enrolled in the fall term who attended college for the first time in the prior summer session (applicable to academic reporters only) Students who entered with advanced standing (any college credits or recognized postsecondary credential earned before graduation from high school)

In order to be considered degree or certificate-seeking, the student must be enrolled in courses for credit and be recognized by the institution as seeking a

degree or other recognized postsecondary credential. Note: All students eligible to receive federal student financial aid are to be considered

degree/certificate-seeking. High school students enrolled in college courses for credit are not degree/certificate-seeking students.

Program Reporters: Include first-time students who entered your institution between August 1, 2024 and October 31, 2024.

Academic Reporters: Student counts reported in column 1 define the initial cohort for reporting graduation rates in the IPEDS Graduation Rates (GR)

component to meet Student Right-to-Know reporting requirements. Students reported in this group will become your GR cohort in the reporting year

appropriate for your institution. The number of students reported in column 1 will also appear in Part D to be used in determining the percentage of the

undergraduate entering class represented by the cohort.

Full-time, transfer-in degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students

In column 2, report the total number of full-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students entering the reporting institution for the first time but

known to have previously attended a postsecondary institution at the undergraduate level. Include students enrolled in the fall term who transferred into

the institution the prior summer session. These students may or may not have transferred credit(s).

Program Reporters: Include students who transferred into your institution between August 1, 2024 and October 31, 2024

Academic Reporters: Include students who transferred into your institution as of the institution's official fall reporting date or October 15, 2024 and those

who transferred in the prior summer session.

Full-time, continuing degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students

In column 3, report the total number of continuing (i.e., not first-time and not transfer-in) full-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students.

These are students who are not new to the institution in the fall, but instead are continuing their studies at the institution.

Full-time, non-degree/non-certificate-seeking full-time undergraduates

In column 5, report the total number of full-time non-degree/non-certificate-seeking undergraduates. These students are enrolled for credit but not with the

intent of earning a degree or other recognized postsecondary credential.



https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/public/survey-materials/forms?surveyid=6&instructionid=30077&formid=77 24/30

Note: High school students enrolled in creditable courses prior to high school graduation are considered non-degree/non-certificate-seeking students.

Once you save the data by clicking the 'Verify and Save' button, the 'Total full-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates' (column 4) and 'Total, full-time undergraduate students' (column 6) will be calculated by the system and display on the survey screen.





Part A: Part-time Undergraduate Students

Report part-time students using the same definitions and instructions provided for full-time undergraduate students.





Part A: Fall Enrollment – Gender Unknown or another gender than Provided Categories For both undergraduate and graduate students, report how many students you had to allocate to a binary gender category (Men/Women) because their gender was unknown or another gender than the provided categories (Men/Women). If your institution is not able to report another gender, please select 'No, my institution is not able to report another gender' to the question and leave the cells in the 'Another gender' row blank (do not input 0s). If you institution collects data on another gender, but some cells will have a value of less than 5 students, please select 'No, some cells will have a value of less than 5 students,' do not report the data and leave the cells in the rows for 'Another gender' blank. If you indicate 'Yes', but no students identified as another gender, please enter '0' in the appropriate row(s).



Part A: Enrollment by Distance Education Status

On this screen, report all students reported on previous Part A screens who are:

Enrolled exclusively in distance education courses offered at your institution: Students who are enrolled only in courses that are considered distance education courses at your institution.

Enrolled in at least one but not all distance education courses offered at your institution: Students who are enrolled in at least one course that is considered a distance education course, but are not enrolled exclusively in distance education courses.

Note:

Requirements for coming to campus for orientation, testing, or academic support services do not exclude a course from being classified as exclusively distance education. Similarly, if a student is taking instructional portions of their program entirely online, but are then required to complete a practicum, residency, or internship, the student can still be considered enrolled in entirely distance education courses. If a student is enrolled at the home institution but takes distance education courses from a consortium member institution, distance education enrollment should be reported at the consortium member institution, not the home institution. If a student is taking distance education courses at BOTH the home institution and a consortium member institution, the student should be reported as enrolled in distance education courses at BOTH institutions.

Not enrolled in any distance education courses offered at your institution: This number represents the students who are not enrolled in any distance education courses at your institution. It will be calculated by subtracting the (students enrolled exclusively in distance education + students enrolled in some but not all distance education courses) from the total enrolled students from Part A, which is the totals for degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates and non-degree/non-certificate-seeking undergraduates.

Location of students enrolled exclusively in distance education courses

If there are students reported as enrolled exclusively in distance education courses, further data on the location of these distance education students will need to be reported. Report, by student level and undergraduate degree/certificate-seeking status, the number of exclusively distance education students that are located in the same state/jurisdiction as the institution, in a different state/jurisdiction than the institution, in the U.S. but the state/jurisdiction is unknown, and residing outside the U.S. Location for those students enrolled exclusively in distance education should be their physical location or current address, as of the institution's Fall reporting date. If this is not available, use the address on file for the student. For students enlisted in the military on active duty, use the permanent address instead of the student's physical location or current address.

The total students exclusively enrolled in distance education courses will be carried forward from earlier on the screen. If the total students reported by location does not equal the total enrolled exclusively in distance education from above, the “Location unknown/unreported” is calculated.





Part B: Fall Enrollment by Age and Gender

Part B is optional this year. This part is optional in even-numbered years. This distribution of students should include all students reported in Part A.

This distribution of students should include all students reported in Part A.

Enrollment by Age

Use institutional records to calculate student age.

Academic reporters: report student age as of the institution's official fall reporting date or as of October 15, 2024. Program reporters: report student age as of August 1, 2024.

The totals by gender for each attendance status (full- or part-time) and student level (undergraduate or graduate) will be carried forward from the corresponding Part A screens. When the Part B and Part A totals do not agree, the "Age unknown/unreported" is calculated.

Note: If the Part B student count total is larger than the total carried forward from Part A (resulting in a negative value), a fatal error results. In this case, reexamine both the age data and comparable portion of Part A to identify the error and make appropriate corrections.





Part C: Residence of First-time Degree/Certificate-Seeking Undergraduate Students Part C is required this year. This part is required in even-numbered years only.

This distribution of students should include all first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students (both full- and part-time) reported in Part A.

Recent High School Graduates Screening Question

Part C begins with a screening question to determine whether or not your institution has first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who enrolled within 12 months of graduating high school or receiving their GED. If the answer is 'No', then only one column for all first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates will display in Part C. If the answer is 'Yes', then 2 columns will be reported in Part C, one for all first-time degree/certificate-

https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/public/survey-materials/forms?surveyid=6&instructionid=30077&formid=77 25/30

seeking undergraduates and one for those first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates enrolled within 12 months of graduating high school or

receiving their GED.

State of residence

Use the state identified by the student as his/her permanent address at the time of application to the institution. This may be the legal residence of a parent

or guardian, or the state in which a student has a driver's license or is registered to vote. It is not necessarily the state in which the student's high school is

located.

Residence of first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students

In column (1), report all first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students, both full-time and part-time, by state of residence. The total line for

column (1) will be carried forward from the total first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students reported in Part A. If the sum of the students

reported by state of residence in column (1), lines 1-90, does not agree with the total first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates from Part A, the

"Residence unknown/unreported" (line 98) will be calculated.

Note: When the sum of students by state of residence is larger than the total carried forward from Part A (resulting in a negative value calculated for the

"Residence unknown/unreported" line), a fatal error results. In this case, reexamine both the residence data and comparable section of Part A to identify the

error and make appropriate corrections.

If your institution responded 'Yes' to the screening question, the subset of students from column (1) who enrolled within 12 months of graduating high

school or receiving their GED are to be reported again by their state of residence in column (2).





Part D: Total Undergraduate Entering Class

Program reporters and non-degree-granting institutions do not complete Part D.

Total entering class data are included to address concerns some institutions have raised about the cohort that is defined by the IPEDS Graduation Rates (GR) component. The GR cohort includes only full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students. For institutions with substantial part-time, transfer-in, and non-degree/non-certificate-seeking enrollment, this may result in graduation rates that are not representative of their typical entering class. The total undergraduate entering class is comprised of all first-time undergraduates (full-time and part-time), all transfer-in undergraduates (full-time and part-time) and the subset of non-degree/non-certificate-seeking undergraduates who are new to the institution in the Fall. To reach the total entering class total, Part D follows a line-by-line step process.

Lines D1 - D4 are carried forward from Part A reporting.

In Line D5, report the subset of non-degree/non-certificate-seeking undergraduate students displayed on line D4, who are new to the institution in Fall 2024. Note: high school students enrolled in college courses for credit should not be included in any calculations to determine an institution’s entering class.

Line D6 will calculate the total undergraduate entering students. This is calculated as all first-time students (line D2) + all transfer-in students (line D3) + non-degree/non-certificate-seeking undergraduate students new to the institution in Fall 2024 (line D5).

After clicking 'Save', Line D7 will display the percentage of the undergraduate entering class that is represented by the current GR cohort (the GR cohort is carried forward from Part A and displayed in Line D1). The percentage is calculated as line D1/D6.





Part E: Retention Rates for the First-Time Certificate-Seeking Student Cohort Retention rates examine the percentage of first-time certificate seeking students enrolled in the fall of the prior year that are either still enrolled in the fall of the current year or have completed their program in that time.

The retention cohorts, full-time and part-time, first-time certificate-seeking undergraduates from Fall 2023, are carried forward from Part A of the prior year Fall Enrollment survey component.

On each retention screen (full-time cohort and part-time cohort screens), institutions must:

Verify the preloaded Fall 2023 cohort.

Attendance status (full- or part-time) should be based on the student's Fall 2023 attendance status. Report any exclusions for the cohort (see below for allowable exclusions).

Report any inclusions of first-time study abroad students who were excluded from the first-time cohort but who have re-enrolled at the institution their second year.

Report the total number of students retained from the Fall 2023 cohort. Include students who were reported as first-time but who are studying abroad in Fall 2024.

Total students retained = students from Fall 2023 cohort still enrolled as of Fall 2024 + students from Fall 2023 cohort who completed their program as of Fall 2024.

Academic reporters: Report students retained as of the institution's official fall reporting date or as of October 15, 2024.

Program reporters: Report students retained as of August 1, 2024.

Exclusions:

Institutions may report exclusions for the Fall 2023 cohort. Allowable exclusions are students who left the institution for any of the following reasons:

Died or were totally and permanently disabled

To serve in the armed forces (including those called to active duty)

To serve with a foreign aid service of the Federal Government (e.g., Peace Corps)

To serve on official church missions

The system will compute an adjusted cohort by subtracting the student exclusions from the original cohort prior to calculating the retention rate.

Retention rates will be computed by the system after clicking 'Save.' The retention rate is calculated as:

((Students from Fall 2023 cohort still enrolled + Students from Fall 2023 cohort who completed their program as of Fall 2024)/Adjusted

Fall 2023 cohort)*100.





Part F: Student-to-Faculty Ratio

Graduate only institutions do not complete Part F.

Report the student-to-faculty ratio for undergraduate programs at your institution. A worksheet is available to help determine your institution's ratio. Click on the link from the Part F screen to access the worksheet.



https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/public/survey-materials/forms?surveyid=6&instructionid=30077&formid=77 26/30

Worksheet for Less Than Four-Year Institutions and Four-Year Institutions without Graduate or Professional Programs The worksheet is designed to help institutions determine their student-to-faculty ratio. It is NOT mandatory that you use this worksheet to calculate your student-to-faculty ratio. Data entered on the worksheet will NOT be collected or saved. Make sure to print the screen in order to refer to the ratio calculation for your institution at a later time.

FULL- AND PART-TIME STUDENT DATA:

All student data on the worksheet are either carried forward from Part A or a calculated field.

Lines F1 and F2. Total full-time and total part-time students.

The total number of full- and part-time students are carried forward from Part A.

Line F3. A full-time equivalent (FTE) of the part-time student count.

The FTE will be calculated as line F2 (total part-time student count) * 1/3.

Line F4. Total FTE students.

This is calculated as the sum of lines F1 (total full-time students) and F3 (FTE of part-time students). Line F4 is used in the ratio calculation.

FULL-AND PART-TIME INSTRUCTIONAL STAFF DATA:

Lines F5 and F8 should be reported based on data your institution is reporting in the IPEDS Human Resources (HR) survey component. Please work together with the appropriate staff at your institution to ensure that the data used on this worksheet and reported in the HR component are the same.

In line F5, report the total number of full-time instructional staff as reported on the HR survey component.

In line F8, report the total number of part-time instructional staff as reported on the HR survey component.

Instructional Staff Exclusion for Non-Credit Instructors:

In line F6, report the number of full-time instructional staff reported in line F5 that are teaching exclusively non-credit courses.

In line F9, report the number of part-time instructional staff reported in line F8 that are teaching exclusively non-credit courses.

For institutions that have a large amount of non-credit activity, the above exclusions will better align the student data with the instructional staff data being used in the ratio.

Part-Time Instructional Staff Addition:

In line F10, report the number of administrators or other staff NOT reported to IPEDS as instructors (and therefore not included in the instructional staff count reported in line F8) that are teaching a credit course in the Fall.

For institutions that have administrators and other professionals on staff that are not reported to IPEDS as instructors (because it is not their "primary function") but they teach credit courses, the above allowable addition will produce a more accurate ratio.

With the above instructional staff exclusions and part-time instructional staff addition information above, the system will compute the following on the worksheet:

Line F7. Total adjusted full-time instructional staff.

The adjusted full-time instructional staff is the total full-time instructional staff, excluding those teaching exclusively non-credit classes. The system will calculate line F7 as line F5 (total full-time instructional staff as reported on the HR survey component) minus line F6 (total full-time instructional staff teaching exclusively non-credit courses).

Line F11. Total adjusted part-time instructional staff.

The adjusted part-time instructional staff is the total part-time instructional staff, excluding those teaching exclusively non-credit classes, and adding those administrators and other staff teaching credit courses. The system will calculate line F11 as line F8 (total part-time instructional staff as reported on the HR survey component) minus line F9 (total part-time instructional staff teaching exclusively non-credit courses) + line F10 (administrators and other staff teaching credit courses).

Line F12. Total FTE of adjusted part-time instructional staff.

The FTE will be calculated as line F11 (total adjusted part-time instructional staff) * 1/3.

Line F13. Total FTE of adjusted instructional staff.

This is calculated as the sum of lines F7 (total adjusted full-time instructional staff) and F12 (FTE of total adjusted part-time instructional staff). Line F13 is used in the ratio calculation.

Line F14. Student-to-faculty ratio.

The ratio will be calculated by the system as line F4 (total adjusted FTE students) divided by line F13 (total adjusted FTE instructional staff). The ratio will be displayed on the worksheet as xxx to 1.

The calculated ratio can then be entered onto the Part F (Student-to-Faculty Ratio) screen.
