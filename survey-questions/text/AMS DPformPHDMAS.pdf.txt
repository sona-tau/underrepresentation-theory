tion.

• The counts of full-time graduate students reported in the first row should include the counts of first-year full-

time graduate students reported in the second row.

• Include in your counts graduate students in your department studying mathematics education.

• UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES include any person who is a US citizen or permanent resident and who
