Dear PhD recipient,



Congratulations on receiving your doctorate!



On behalf of the sponsoring societies for the Mathematical and Statistical Sciences Annual Survey (AMS, ASA, IMS, MAA, and SIAM), we are writing to ask that you complete a brief questionnaire regarding your PhD degree, your experience completing it, and your career direction. Your department chair or other representative has forwarded this request to you on our behalf, and we ask that you return your completed questionnaire to him or her within the time frame mentioned below.



With the exception of your dissertation title, the data collected will be anonymized, and an aggregated analysis will be published in a report in Notices of the American Mathematical Society.



It is our hope that these reports will provide recognition of your achievements, valuable insights for other students in these programs, guidance for individuals contemplating careers based in mathematical and statistical training, and insight for those who guide and support graduate programs in the mathematical and statistical sciences.



Please complete the attached fillable pdf form and return it via email to your department contact no later than August 30, 2020. We are relying heavily on your initiative to help in making our report as comprehensive and authoritative as possible, so we hope you will respond in a timely fashion.



Please accept our thanks in advance for your willingness to participate. To underscore those thanks, if you complete the form by this date, we will enter you into a drawing for one of ten US$100 Amazon gift cards. The drawing will be held in December 2020.



If you have questions or concerns about this survey, you many contact us by email at: ams-survey@ams.org.



Again, congratulations on achieving the milestone of earning a PhD!



Best regards,

Amanda Golbeck, chair, AMS-ASA-IMS-MAA-SIAM Joint Data Committee

Tom Barr, AMS Special Projects Officer
