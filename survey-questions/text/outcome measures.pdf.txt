Outcome Measures

Overview

Outcome Measures Overview

Welcome to the IPEDS Outcome Measures (OM) survey component. The OM component collects award and enrollment data from degree-granting institutions on four undergraduate cohorts and eight undergraduate subcohorts at three status points: four-years, six-years, and eight-years after entry.

The four cohorts of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates are:

First-time, full-time entering (FTFT)

First-time, part-time entering (FTPT)

Non-first-time, full-time entering (NFTFT)

Non-first-time, part-time entering (NFTPT)

For each cohort, two subcohort groups have been added to the OM component - Pell Grant recipients and Non-Pell Grant recipients - resulting in eight undergraduate subcohorts.

Data Reporting Reminders:

Report data to accurately reflect the time period corresponding with the IPEDS survey component, even if such reporting is seemingly inconsistent with prior-year reporting.

All institutions must report on a FULL-YEAR cohort. The OM cohort year is 2016-17. The full-year cohort coverage period is July 1, 2016 - June 30, 2017. Institutions will establish their OM cohorts based on their subcohorts of entering Pell Grant recipients and Non-Pell Grant recipients. Institutions should first identify their entering degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates during the cohort coverage period of July 1, 2016 - June 30, 2017, and place each student in the appropriate subcohort. Each student should be reported only once.

All institutions are required to report transfer-out student data.

For each status point, institutions will report the highest type of award conferred to a student for each subcohort. The three award categories are certificates, Associate's degree, and Bachelor's degree.

Institutions should report exclusions for the entire eight year period only on the "Establishing Cohorts" screen. Additional exclusions cannot be reported on the status point screens (i.e., four-years, six-years, or eight-years after entry).

IPEDS will ask for an estimated time it took to complete the OM component. Include in that estimate the time to review instructions, research data sources (i.e., coordinate with IT and Student Aid offices), complete and review the component, and submit the data.

Changes to reporting:

The following changes were implemented for the 2024-25 data collection period:

Revised FAQ about “non-first-time” degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students.

Added a new FAQ to better clarify the relationship between “transfer-in” enrollment status on the Fall Enrollment (EF) and 12-month Enrollment (E12) components and the “non-first-time” cohort on the Outcome Measures (OM) component.

Added a new example to FAQ about students who change from non-degree/non-certificate-seeking to degree/certificate-seeking at the IPEDS reporting institution.

Added additional information to FAQ about resources for tracking subsequent enrollment.

Revised definition for “Non-first-time student (undergraduate)” Glossary term to improve clarity.

Important Dates to Remember:

All reporting institutions will report on degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who entered the 2016-17 cohort year: (July 1, 2016-June 30, 2017).

Four-year status point was as of August 31, 2020

Six-year status point was as of August 31, 2022

Eight-year status point was as of August 31, 2024

Reporting Tips

Carefully read each OM FAQ before reporting your institution's data.

2016-17 Entering Undergraduate Cohort

July 1, 2016-June 30, 2017: Full Year

Begin by identifying your entering degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates for the full year of July 1, 2016 - June 30, 2017. Then report each student under one of the eight subcohorts (Pell or Non-Pell Grant recipients FTFT, FTPT, NFTFT, NFTPT). Each entering student should be reported only once.

The four cohorts and total entering students will be calculated based on your subcohort reporting.

NOTE: Once a student is in the cohort, the student remains in the cohort, even if the student's attendance status changes (i.e., full-time to part-time, or vice versa) or if the student drops out, transfers out, or transfers back into the institution during the eight-year period. However, institutions can make adjustments to the cohort for allowable exclusions, which include the death of a student, total and permanent disability, military deployment, or service on an official church mission or with a foreign aid service of the Federal government. Exclusions are for the ENTIRE eight years for the entering 2016-17 cohort.

Purpose of Survey

The purpose of the IPEDS Outcome Measures (OM) survey component is to provide the award and enrollment statuses of four degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate student cohorts and eight subcohorts at degree-granting institutions. Student completion awarded by the reporting institution are collected at the four-years, six-years, and eight-years status points after they entered the reporting institution. The enrollment status of students who did not earn an award is also collected at the eight-years status point.





Changes in reporting

The following changes were implemented for the 2024-25 data collection period:

Revised FAQ about “non-first-time” degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students.

Added a new FAQ to better clarify the relationship between “transfer-in” enrollment status on the Fall Enrollment (EF) and 12-month Enrollment (E12) components and the “non-first-time” cohort on the Outcome Measures (OM) component.

Added a new example to FAQ about students who change from non-degree/non-certificate-seeking to degree/certificate-seeking at the IPEDS reporting institution.

Added additional information to FAQ about resources for tracking subsequent enrollment.

Revised definition for “Non-first-time student (undergraduate)” Glossary term to improve clarity.

As a reminder, when reporting the Outcome Measures component, all degree-granting institutions will report on:

1. full-year cohorts (e.g., July 1, 2016 and June 30, 2017),

2. the Pell Grant and Non-Pell Grant recipients subcohorts for each of the four OM cohorts. First-time, full-time (FTFT); First-time, part-time (FTPT); Non-

First-Time, Full-time(NFTFT), and Non-First-Time, Part-time (NFTPT),

3. three status points (four-years, six-years, and eight-years),

4. the highest undergraduate award (i.e., certificate award, Associate’s degree or Bachelor’s degree) for each status point, and 5. all students who transferred out.





General Instructions



Reporting Period Covered

This OM component requests data on four cohorts of entering degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates enrolled in your institution during the cohort coverage period between July 1, 2016 and June 30, 2017. To report data on the four cohorts, institutions will report on eight subcohorts of undergraduates who either received a Pell Grant or did not during the OM coverage cohort period. Institutions are to report the award status of these students as of August 31, 2020 (Four-Years Status) and August 31, 2022 (Six-Years Status), and the award and enrollment status of these students as of August 31, 2024 (Eight-Years Status).



Context Boxes

Context boxes are provided to allow institutions to provide more information regarding survey component items. Note that some context boxes are posted on

the College Navigator Website, which is the college search tool offered by NCES. NCES will review entries in these context boxes for applicability and

appropriateness before posting them on the College Navigator Website; institutions should check grammar and spelling of their entries.





Coverage



https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/public/survey-materials/forms?surveyid=13&instructionid=30101&formid=101 8/14 The Outcome Measures component collects data from degree-granting institutions on the following degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate student cohorts and subcohorts:





First-time, full-time entering students (FTFT)


Pell Grant recipients

Non-Pell Grant recipients

First-time, part-time entering students (FTPT)

Pell Grant recipients

Non-Pell Grant recipients

Non-first-time, full-time entering students (NFTFT)

Pell Grant recipients

Non-Pell Grant recipients

Non-first-time, part-time entering students (NFTPT)

Pell Grant recipients

Non-Pell Grant recipients

Each of the four cohorts will be calculated from the reported Pell Grant and Non-Pell Grant recipient subcohorts.

Who to Include in the Cohorts

All degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates should be reported in one of the subcohorts in the 12-month reporting period they become degree/certificate-

seeking. This typically aligns to when students enter the IPEDS reporting institution. However, students who begin at the IPEDS reporting institution as non-

degree/non-certificate-seeking and change to degree/certificate-seeking during the 12-month reporting period should also be included in the relevant OM

cohort. All institutions will report using a full-year cohort, which counts all students who entered the institution between July 1, 2016 and June 30, 2017 (i.e.,

the coverage cohort year). For academic reporting institutions, report students who were enrolled through the term's Census Date for enrollment purposes. For

program/hybrid reporting institutions, report students who were enrolled for at least 15 days in a program of up to, and including, one year in length, or 30

days in a program of greater than one year in length.



Students must be enrolled in courses creditable toward a degree, diploma, certificate, or other recognized postsecondary credential. Include students enrolled

in courses that are part of a vocational or occupational program, INCLUDING those enrolled in off-campus centers and those enrolled in distance learning/home

study programs.



Be sure to include students taking remedial courses if the student is considered degree-seeking for the purpose of student financial aid determination.

A student who is designated as a member of a cohort remains in that cohort, even if the student:

Started as either a full-time or part-time student and later changes attendance status.

Transfers to another institution.

Drops out of the institution.

Stops out of the institution.

Has not fulfilled the institution's requirements to receive a degree or certificate.

Went on a study abroad program the first year upon entering the institution.

Who to Exclude from the Cohort

DO NOT include students in the cohort who are:

Enrolled exclusively in courses not creditable toward a recognized postsecondary credential or the completion of a vocational program. Exclusively taking Continuing Education Units (CEUs).

Exclusively auditing classes.

Foreign students who are only taking coursework at a host institution (e.g., an American institution overseas), if these students are not enrolled at a U.S. institution.

https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/public/survey-materials/forms?surveyid=13&instructionid=30101&formid=101 9/14 Reporting Instructions

A. Establishing Cohorts

OM has four cohorts: FTFT, FTPT, NFTFT, and NFTPT. OM also has eight subcohorts based on a student's Pell Grant recipient status. Students are reported only once in one of the subcohorts.

1. Report on a Full Year Cohort

1. Regardless of reporting type (i.e., academic, program, or hybrid), all institutions will report to OM using a full-year cohort of students. Do not use a fall

cohort. Entering students are identified as those students who entered the institution between July 1, 2016 and June 30, 2017 - the coverage cohort year.

2. Determine if a student enters the OM cohort year based on official enrollment procedures. For academic reporters, include undergraduate students who

were enrolled in your institution's official census date for their entering term (i.e., semester or quarter). For program/hybrid reporters, report students who were enrolled for at least 15 days in a program of up to, and including, one year in length, or 30 days in a program of greater than one year in length.

2. Determining Cohort Status

1. A student's cohort status is determined in the first full term (i.e., semester or quarter) that a student becomes degree/certificate-seeking (typically as an

entering student). For example, if a degree/certificate-seeking transfer-in student entered an institution in the Spring term of the coverage cohort year as part-time, this student should be in OM's part-time, non-first-time cohort.

2. Degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who take a summer session preceding the start of OM coverage cohort year (July 1, 2016 and June 30,

2017) should be reported in the full year 2016-17 cohort. The cohort status of a summer session student is determined by that student's immediate full-term enrollment. For example, a first-time student takes a summer session that starts May 31, 2017 and enrolls the following fall term as a full-time student. This student should be in OM's full-time, first-time cohort.

3. Pell Grant and Non-Pell Grant Recipient Subcohorts

1. Each OM cohort (FTFT, FTPT, NFTFT, and NFTPT) has two subcohorts of Pell Grant and Non-Pell Grant recipients. For each subcohort, report the number of

students that received a Pell Grant and those that did not receive a Pell Grant (i.e., Non-Pell Grant recipients).

2. Students with disbursed Pell Grants during the OM coverage cohort year of July 1, 2016 and June 30, 2017 are reported in a Pell Grant subcohort. 3. Students who did not receive a disbursed Pell Grant during the cohort coverage period, but received a Pell Grant after the coverage cohort year (i.e., July

1, 2017 to August 31, 2024) are excluded from a Pell Grant subcohort. Report these students in a Non-Pell Grant subcohort.

4. Students, who were awarded but not disbursed a Pell Grant during the coverage cohort year, should be excluded from a Pell Grant subcohort, and reported

in a Non-Pell Grant subcohort.

5. Students, who receive any other forms of student aid, but no Pell Grant during the coverage cohort year, should be reported in the Non-Pell Grant

subcohort.

4. Exclusions to the 2016-17 Cohort (from entry through August 31, 2024)Institutions may choose to exclude students who left your institution after the point of entry through August 31, 2024 for one of the following allowable reasons:

1. The student is deceased or is totally and permanently disabled and thus unable to return to school. 2. The student left school to serve in the armed forces or was called to active duty. (DO NOT include students already in the military who transfer to another

duty station.)

3. The student left school to serve with a foreign aid service of the Federal Government, such as the Peace Corps. 4. The student left school to serve on an official church mission.

NOTE: Students who leave the institution for one of the reasons noted in 2, 3, or 4 above, but return before the status date of August 31, 2024, may be subtracted from the cohort. Review the FAQs for more information on OM exclusions.

5. Adjusted 2016-17 Cohort

For each cohort and subcohort, the adjusted cohort is calculated by subtracting the "Exclusions to 2016-17 cohort" from the "2016-17 cohort".





B. Award Status at Four Years

For each subcohort of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students, report the number of students that received an award by four years after entering your institution.



All students entering in the 2016-17 full-year cohort should be reported in one of the eight subcohorts. Report each student only once.



The adjusted 2016-17 Cohort has been brought forward to this screen from the "Establishing Cohorts" screen. The adjusted cohort is calculated by subtracting the eight-year exclusions from the 2016-17 cohort.



Number of students conferred an award by your institution (highest award through August 31, 2020): From the adjusted 2016-17 cohort, report the number of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who earned an award (i.e., certificates, associate's or bachelor's) by four years after entry for each subcohort. If a student earned multiple awards, count the student once and report the highest award conferred to the student by the status point (August 31, 2020).

Include non-degree awards in the "certificates" column. Report the highest award conferred by your institution at the four-year status point even if the students are still enrolled at your institution or have transferred to another institution. DO NOT include graduate awards conferred to undergraduate students.



Total number of adjusted cohort that received an award from your institution: This column will calculate total number of highest awards conferred by your institution by the four-year status point (August 31, 2020).



Percent of adjusted cohort that received an award from your institution by August 31, 2020: This column will calculate the proportion of entering students who received an award from your institution for each adjusted subcohort. This four-year award rate is derived from the Total number of adjusted cohort that received an award from your institution divided by Adjusted 2016-17 Cohort.





https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/public/survey-materials/forms?surveyid=13&instructionid=30101&formid=101 10/14

C. Award Status at Six Years

For each subcohort of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students, report the number of students that received an award by six years after entering

your institution.



All students entering in the 2016-17 full-year cohort should be reported in one of the eight subcohorts. Report each student only once.



The adjusted 2016-17 Cohort has been brought forward to this screen from the "Establishing Cohorts" screen. The adjusted cohort is calculated by

subtracting the eight-year exclusions from the 2016-17 cohort.



Number of students conferred an award by your institution (highest award through August 31, 2022): From the adjusted 2016-17 cohort, report

the number of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who earned an award (i.e., certificates, associate's or bachelor's) by six years after entry for

each subcohort. If a student earned multiple awards, count the student once and report the highest award conferred to the student by the status point

(August 31, 2022).

Include non-degree awards in the "certificates" column. Report the highest award conferred by your institution at the 6-year status point even if the students

are still enrolled at your institution or have transferred to another institution. DO NOT include graduate awards conferred to undergraduate students.



Total number of adjusted cohort that received an award from your institution: This column will calculate total number of highest awards conferred by

your institution by the six-year status point (August 31, 2022).



Percent of adjusted cohort that received an award from your institution by August 31, 2022: This column will calculate the proportion of entering

students who received an award from your institution for each adjusted subcohort. This six-year award rate is derived from the Total number of adjusted cohort

that received an award from your institution divided by Adjusted 2016-17 Cohort.





D. Award and Enrollment Status at Eight Years

1. Award Status at Eight Years After Entry

For each subcohort of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students, report the number of students that received an award by eight years after entering

your institution.



All students entering in 2016-17 full-year cohort should be reported in one of the eight subcohorts. Report each student only once.



The adjusted 2016-17 Cohort has been brought forward to this screen from the "Establishing Cohorts" screen. The adjusted cohort is calculated by

subtracting the eight-year exclusions from the 2016-17 cohort.



Number of students conferred an award by your institution (highest award through August 31, 2024): From the adjusted 2016-17 cohort, report

the number of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who earned an award (i.e., certificates, associate's or bachelor's) by eight years after entry

for each subcohort. If a student earned multiple awards, count the student once and report the highest award conferred to the student by the status point

(August 31, 2024).

Include non-degree awards in the "certificates" column. Report the highest award conferred by your institution at the eight-year status point even if the

students are still enrolled at your institution or have transferred to another institution. DO NOT include graduate awards conferred to undergraduate students.



Total number of adjusted cohort that received an award from your institution: This column will calculate total number of highest awards conferred by

your institution by the eight-year status point (August 31, 2024).



Percent of adjusted cohort that received an award from your institution by August 31, 2024: This column will calculate the proportion of entering

students who received an award from your institution for each adjusted subcohort. This eight-year award rate is derived from the Total number of adjusted

cohort that received an award from your institution divided by Adjusted 2016-17 Cohort.



2. Enrollment Status at Eight Years After Entry

For the remaining students in your adjusted subcohorts who have not earned an award from your institution by August 31, 2024, report each of these students

in the one of the enrollment status columns.

Note: Subsequent enrollment should be tracked for the entire period of eight years after entry.



Number of students who did not receive an award from your institution (from entry through August 31, 2024):

Number still enrolled at your institution: Report the number of students still enrolled at your institution as of August 31, 2024. Do not include any students who have received an award by August 31, 2024. You may include students who you know are enrolling at your institution in the fall term immediately following August 31, 2024.

Number who enrolled at another institution after leaving your institution: Report the total number of students who transferred out of your institution without an award (i.e., a degree, diploma, certificate, or other recognized postsecondary credential) and enrolled in another institution at any time from point of entry through August 31, 2024. You may include students who you know are enrolling at the other institution in the fall term immediately following August 31, 2024. Only include students for whom you have confirmed subsequent enrollment.

Number of students whose subsequent enrollment status is unknown: This column will be calculated by subtracting the sum of the Number still enrolled at your institution, the Number who enrolled at another institution after leaving your institution, and the Total number of adjusted cohort that received an award from your institution (through August 31, 2024) from the Adjusted 2016-17 cohort.

Total number of students who did not receive an award from your institution: The total number of students who did not receive an award by August 31, 2024 will be calculated by summing three columns: Number still enrolled at your institution, Number who enrolled at another institution after leaving your institution, and Number of students whose subsequent enrollment status is unknown.

Percent of the adjusted cohort that did not receive an award, but are still enrolled at your institution or enrolled at another institution after leaving your institution: This column will calculate the proportion of students who are still enrolled at your institution as of August 31, 2024, or left your institution and subsequently enrolled at another institution. The sum of the values from the Number still enrolled at your institution and Number who enrolled at another institution after leaving your institution are divided by Adjusted 2016-17 Cohort.

Term Definition

The result of removing any allowable exclusions from a cohort (or subcohort). For the Fall Enrollment component, it is the

cohort for calculating retention rate; for the Graduation Rates component, this is the cohort from which graduation and transfer-

Adjusted cohort

out rates are calculated; and for the Outcome Measures component, these are the four cohorts (first-time, full-time; first-time, part-time; non-first-time, full-time; or non-first-time, part-time) for which outcomes rates are calculated at 4, 6, and 8 years.

Associate's degree An award that normally requires at least 2 but less than 4 years of full-time equivalent college work.

An award (baccalaureate or equivalent degree, as determined by the Secretary, U.S. Department of Education) that normally

requires at least 4 but not more than 5 years of full-time equivalent college-level work. This includes all bachelor's degrees

Bachelor's degree conferred in a 5-year cooperative (work-study) program. A cooperative plan provides for alternate class attendance and

employment in business, industry, or government; thus, it allows students to combine actual work experience with their college studies. Also includes bachelor's degrees in which the normal 4 years of work are completed in 3 years.

Calculated value (CV) is used to designate fields that are generated (or calculated) based on data provided on other lines within

Calculated value (CV) the same part of a survey component. For example, a "balance" line or "other (detail)" line will be calculated as the difference

between the total line and the sum of the remaining detail.

successful completion of a program of studies.

Students enrolled in courses for credit who are seeking a degree, certificate, or other recognized postsecondary credential. This includes students who:

- received any type of federal financial aid, regardless of what courses they took at any time;

Degree/certificate-seeking - received any state or locally based financial aid with an eligibility requirement that the student be enrolled in a degree,

students (DCGS) certificate, or transfer-seeking program; or

- obtained a student visa to study at a U.S. postsecondary institution

High school students also enrolled in postsecondary courses for credit are not considered degree/certificate-seeking.

Those students who may be removed (deleted) from a cohort (or subcohort). For the Graduation Rates, Outcome Measures,

and Fall Enrollment retention rate reporting, students may be removed from a cohort if they left the institution for one of the

A student who has no prior postsecondary experience (except as noted below) attending any institution for the first time at the

First-time student undergraduate level. This includes students enrolled in academic or occupational programs. It also includes students enrolled

(undergraduate) in the fall term who attended college for the first time in the prior summer session, and students who entered with advanced

standing (college credits or recognized postsecondary credential earned before graduation from high school).

Undergraduate: A student enrolled for 12 or more semester credits, or 12 or more quarter credits, or 24 or more clock hours a week each term. Graduate: A student enrolled for 9 or more semester credits, or 9 or more quarter credits, or a student involved

This is a group of students entering at any time during the 12-month period for tracking and reporting. For Graduation Rate (GR),

a full-year cohort is from September 1 through August 31 and is used primarily by institutions that offer occupational programs

Full-year cohort of varying lengths. Students must be full-time and first-time to be considered in the cohort. For Outcome Measures (OM)

component, all degree-granting institutions report on a full-year cohort from July 1 through June 30. Students are reported once in one of the four OM cohorts: first-time, full-time; first-time, part-time: non-first-time, full-time; or non-first-time, part-time.

The Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), conducted by the NCES, began in 1986 and involves annual

institution-level data collections. All postsecondary institutions that have a Program Participation Agreement with the Office of

Integrated Postsecondary Postsecondary Education (OPE), U.S. Department of Education (throughout IPEDS referred to as "Title IV") are required to report

Education Data System data using a web-based data collection system. IPEDS currently consists of the following components: Institutional

(IPEDS) Characteristics (IC); 12-month Enrollment (E12);Completions (C); Admissions (ADM); Student Financial Aid (SFA); Human

Resources (HR) composed of Employees by Assigned Position, Fall Staff, and Salaries; Fall Enrollment (EF); Graduation Rates

(GR); Outcome Measures (OM); Finance (F); and Academic Libraries (AL).

degree/non-certificate-seeking (not as a high school student) but became degree/certificate-seeking during the Outcome Measures (OM) cohort reporting period.

Outcome Measures (OM) This annual component aims to improve the collection of student progression and completion data on a more diverse group of

undergraduate students at degree-granting institutions. Award and enrollment statuses are collected on four cohorts (first-time,
