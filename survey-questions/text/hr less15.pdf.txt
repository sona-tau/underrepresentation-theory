Human Resources for degree-granting institutions and related administrative offices that have less than 15 full-time

staff

Overview

Human Resources Overview

Welcome to the IPEDS Human Resources (HR) survey component. The HR component collects important information about your institution's staff.



Data Reporting Reminders

Report data to accurately reflect the time period corresponding with the IPEDS survey component, even if such reporting is seemingly inconsistent with prior-year reporting.

Report each employee only once. If an employee could be coded in more than one occupation, code the employee in the occupation that requires the highest level of skill OR if there is no measurable difference in skill requirements, code the employee in the occupation in which they spend the most time. Report staff members difficult to categorize in the "Human Resources Survey Evaluation" box at the end of the survey. Enter data on each displayed screen. If a screen is not applicable, enter at least one zero in a field on the screen and save before continuing. When reporting salary data (applicable to degree-granting institutions only) include all full-time, non-medical school, instructional staff - both with and without faculty status.

See the instructions for the Key Reporting Concepts section -- which will have basic reporting concepts that will assist you in completing the Human Resources survey component.

Changes to reporting:

No changes for the 2024-25 data collection period.



Resources:

To download the survey materials for this component: Survey Materials

All staff must now be reported using the new IPEDS occupational categories, which align with the 2018 Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) codes.

Additional information and resources can be found in the IPEDS HR/SOC Information Center, including general information about the SOC, the IPEDS/SOC crosswalk, a SOC Browse Tool, Frequently Asked Questions, and Web Tutorials.

Purpose of the Survey Component

The primary purpose of the Human Resources (HR) survey component is to measure the number and type of staff supporting postsecondary education in terms of employment status (full-time and part-time) and occupational category. In addition, for degree-granting institutions and related administrative offices that have less than 15 full-time staff, salary data for full-time, non-medical school staff are also collected, and some data are collected by medical/non-medical school status for 4-year and above degree-granting institutions with Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) and/or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) programs.

The reporting of data by race/ethnicity and gender is now required every year.

Special note for state and corporate systems: If a separate, administrative office entity has been established for the system in IPEDS, that entity will report all staff associated with the administrative office. If no separate administrative office entity has been created, administrative office staff will be reported by the main campus of the system. If you have any questions concerning whether a separate reporting entity exists for your system, please contact your system's coordinator or keyholder, or the IPEDS Help Desk for further assistance.

Detailed Instructions



Summary of Parts

Listed below is a summary of each section of the HR survey component.

Part A - Full-time staff: Collects the number of full-time staff by occupational category. Part B - Part-time staff: Collects the number of part-time staff by occupational category.

NOTE: Parts D through F are not applicable to degree-granting institutions with less than 15 full-time staff members.

Part G - Salaries: Collects the number of full-time, non-medical, instructional staff by academic rank based on the number of months covered by their annual salary: 9 months, 10 months, 11 months, or 12 months; as well as the total annual salary outlays for these staff by academic rank. In addition, total annual salary outlays are collected for full-time, non-medical school, non-instructional staff by occupational category.

You must enter data on each displayed screen. If a screen is not applicable to your institution, enter at least one zero in a field on the screen and save the screen before continuing.

For screens that ARE applicable to your institution, once data are entered in one or more cells on the screen it is not necessary to enter zeros in inapplicable cells/rows/columns. In this case, cells that are left blank will be treated as zeros.





Screening Questions

Please read and answer the screening questions in the data collection system very carefully. These questions must be answered before providing detailed data. Responses to the screening questions will determine which items of the survey must be completed by your institution.





Part A - Full-time Staff

In Part A, report the number of full-time staff at the institution by occupational category and medical school status (if applicable).

All staff must be reported using the new IPEDS occupational categories, which align with the 2018 Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) codes. Report each employee only once. If an employee in a single job could be coded in more than one occupation:

code the employee in the occupation that requires the highest level of skill

- OR -

if there is no measurable difference in skill requirements, code the employee in the occupation in which they spend the most time

For additional information relevant to reporting full-time staff in Part A, please refer to the Key Reporting Concepts section of these instructions below.





Part B - Part-time Staff

In Part B, report the number of part-time staff (including graduate assistants, if applicable) at the institution by occupational category and medical school status (if applicable).

All staff must be reported using the new IPEDS occupational categories, which align with the 2018 Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) codes.

Report each employee only once. If an employee in a single job could be coded in more than one occupation:

code the employee in the occupation that requires the highest level of skill

- OR -

if there is no measurable difference in skill requirements, code the employee in the occupation in which they spend the most time

For additional information relevant to reporting part-time staff in Part B, please refer to the Key Reporting Concepts section of these instructions below.





Part G - Salaries

Full-time, non-medical school, instructional staff

On the "Salaries Worksheet" screen, report the number of full-time, non-medical school, instructional staff at the institution by gender and academic rank. Academic ranks include Professors, Associate professors, Assistant professors, Instructors, Lecturers, and No academic rank. Counts should be reported based on the number of months of work covered by the annual salary paid to the employee: 12 months, 11 months, 10 months, 9 months, and less than 9 months. This includes instructional staff with and without faculty status. The number of

https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/public/survey-materials/forms?surveyid=1&instructionid=30045&formid=45 20/30





months reported should correspond with the number of months worked (which may differ from the number of months over which they are paid).


For each gender and academic rank category, the system will calculate:

1. The total number of staff reported (i.e. the sum of the values entered in the less than 9 months, 9 months, 10 months, 11 months, and 12 months categories);

2. Total staff for salary reporting (i.e. the sum of the values entered in the 12 months, 11 months, 10 months, and 9 months categories).

The above two values will be carried forward to the "Salary Outlays" screen. Here you must report the TOTAL ANNUAL salary outlays for the full-time, non-medical school, instructional staff reported on the "Salaries Worksheet" screen by academic rank. This should include the staff reported in the 9 months, 10 months, 11 months, and 12 months categories. Do NOT include salary outlays for employees whose annual salary covers fewer than 9 months worked. Based on the data provided, the system will calculate the "Equated 9 month average" by academic rank.



Full-time, non-medical school, non-instructional staff

You must also report the TOTAL ANNUAL salary outlays for full-time, non-medical school, non-instructional staff at the institution by occupational category.



Report total annual salary outlays for 2024-25.

Salary outlays (combined salaries of all staff) should include base salaries only - no supplements, overloads, or bonuses. Additional stipends for administrative, managerial, or other responsibilities should NOT be included in the salary outlays data for instructional staff.

Staff on leave: When reporting staff on sabbatical leave and staff who are on leave but remain on the payroll of the institution, report such persons at their regular salaries even though the staff may be receiving a reduced annuity while on leave.

For additional information relevant to reporting Salaries data in Part G, please refer to the Key Reporting Concepts section of these instructions below.





Key Reporting Concepts

The following are key reporting concepts that will assist you with completing the IPEDS Human Resources survey component. Please read all instructions thoroughly prior to entering data.





Reporting Persons by Racial/Ethnic Category (1997 OMB)

This information is being collected in compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and Sec. 421(a) (1) of the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act. These instructions correspond with the Final Guidance on Maintaining, Collecting, and Reporting Racial and Ethnic Data to the U.S. Department of Education, published in the Federal Register on October 19, 2007. Method of collection - Institutions must collect race and ethnicity information using a 2-question format. The first question is whether the respondent is Hispanic/Latino. The second question is whether the respondent is from one or more races from the following list: American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and White. Institutions should allow students and staff to self-identify their race and ethnicity. For further details on the guidance for collecting these data, please see the full Federal Register notice.

Method of reporting aggregate data - Institutions must report aggregate data to the U.S. Department of Education using the NINE categories below. Racial/ethnic designations are requested only for United States citizens and residents.

Hispanic or Latino, regardless of race

For Non-Hispanic/Latino individuals:

American Indian or Alaska Native

Asian

Black or African American

Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander

White

Two or more races

In addition, the following categories may be used:

U.S. Nonresident

Race and ethnicity unknown

Racial/ethnic descriptions - Racial/ethnic designations as used in this survey do not denote scientific definitions of anthropological origins. The categories are:

Hispanic or Latino- A person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race. American Indian or Alaska Native- A person having origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America) who maintains cultural identification through tribal affiliation or community attachment.

Asian- A person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian Subcontinent, including, for example, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam. Black or African American- A person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa. Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander- A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands. White - A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa.

Other descriptive categories

U.S. Nonresident - A person who is not a citizen or national of the United States and who is in this country on a visa or temporary basis and does not have the right to remain indefinitely. NOTE - U.S. Nonresidents are to be reported separately, in the boxes provided, rather than included in any of the seven racial/ethnic categories or in race/ethnicity unknown.

Race and ethnicity unknown - This category is used only if a United States citizen or resident did not select EITHER a racial or ethnic designation.





Instructional Staff

In IPEDS, this category is comprised of staff who are either: 1) Primarily Instruction (PI); or 2) "Instruction combined with Research and/or Public Service" (IRPS). The intent of the "Instructional Staff " category is to include all individuals whose primary occupation includes instruction at the institution. For more information about this category, see the FAQ.





https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/public/survey-materials/forms?surveyid=1&instructionid=30045&formid=45 21/30

Academic Rank



(For degree-granting institutions with less than 15 full-time staff members this is only applicable to Part G - Salaries)

Report Instructional Staff by academic rank (e.g., professor, associate professor, etc.), as designated by the institution. Institutions without standard academic ranks should report all their Instructional Staff in the "No Academic Rank" category.





Adjunct Instructional staff

Adjunct Instructional Staff serve in either a temporary or auxiliary capacity to teach academic degree-credit courses, as well as developmental, or ESL courses, and are paid on a course-by-course basis. They should be reported as either part-time or full-time based on their designation on the institution’s payroll, and as non-tenured instructional staff.





Medical School Staff

4-year and above degree-granting institutions with M.D. and/or D.O. programs report some data specifically for medical school staff. The data for these instituitons are reported in three ways:

Combined: On some screens, data are reported for medical school and non-medical school staff combined. Separately: On some screens, data are reported separately for non-medical school staff and for medical school staff. Excluded: Data are reported for NON-MEDICAL SCHOOL STAFF ONLY in Part G – Salaries.

Staff employed by or working in the medical school (M.D. and/or D.O.) component of a postsecondary institution, or in a freestanding medical school, should be reported as medical school staff. However, this does NOT include:

Employees working strictly in a hospital associated with a medical school.

Those who volunteer their services at the medical school.

Those who work in health or allied health schools or departments such as dentistry, veterinary medicine, nursing, or dental hygiene – unless the health or allied health schools or departments are affiliated with (housed in or under the authority of) the medical school.

NOTE: Staff that are in health disciplines that are NOT considered part of a medical school must be reported on the non-medical school pages.

Free-Standing Hospitals and Medical Centers

Hospitals, medical centers, and other entities that offer postsecondary education programs as part of their mission should report only those staff who work full-time or part-time in the postsecondary education division or component of the institution. If a staff member works full-time for the institution - but only part-time in the postsecondary education division or component - for the purposes of this survey, that person should be reported as part-time in his or her occupational category in the postsecondary education division or component.





Research staff

A staff member should be classified as Research Staff if the majority of their work is focused on conducting research, regardless of their title, academic rank, or tenure status.





Public service staff

A staff member should be classified as Public Service Staff if the majority of their work is focused on carrying out public service activities. These would be staff members who work in agricultural extension services, clinical services, or continuing education, regardless of their title, academic rank, or tenure status. If the staff member is located off campus, such as in an extension office, they should still be classified as Public Service Staff as long as the majority of their work is focused on carrying out public service activities.





Postdoctoral staff

Postdoctoral staff members should be classified based on where the majority of their work is performed. For example, if the postdoc spends the majority of their time conducting research they should be classified as Research Staff. In addition, postdoctoral staff members typically do not have faculty status and they should be reported as “Without faculty status”.





Managers and Supervisors

The Management Occupations category is a direct match to the “11-0000 Management Occupations” SOC category. This category should include those staff whose job it is to plan, direct, or coordinate policies, programs, and may include some supervision of other workers. In addition, Postsecondary Deans should be classified in this category as well, even though they perform similar activities to the workers that they supervise.

All other supervisors should be categorized within the same category as the workers that they supervise. However, there is an exception for those that

supervise workers in the Healthcare Support Occupations. For additional information please refer to the 2018 SOC Classification Principles section of these instructions.





Student and Academic Affairs and Other Education Services Occupations



https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/public/survey-materials/forms?surveyid=1&instructionid=30045&formid=45 22/30 This category includes professionals who work in the areas of student activities, student admissions, student affairs, student career services, student enrollment, student financial aid, student registration and records, campus recreation services, and similar functions. For additional information on whom

should be included in this category, as well as whom should be included in other categories, please see the IPEDS/SOC Crosswalk.





Graduate Assistants

Graduate Assistants are considered part-time employees and should be classified in the occupational category in which the majority of their work is performed. IPEDS only collects information for graduate assistants working in a subset of the occupational categories. Those primarily performing duties in other categories should be excluded. Additional information on reporting Graduate Assistants can be found in the Reporting Graduate Assistants by Occupational Category section of these instructions.





Salaries

Historically, IPEDS has collected average annual salaries. Because there is variation in what an "annual" salary entails, IPEDS now calculates equated 9 month salaries. The salaries worksheet (Part G - screen 1) is used to determine average monthly salaries by collecting the number of Instructional Staff and the number of months they worked, along with the total annual salary outlays for the staff reported in the 12 months, 11 months, 10 months, and the 9 months columns.

Full-time instructional staff should be reported based on the number of months during which they work during the year, NOT the number of months during which they are paid. Additional information on reporting Salaries data can be found in the instructions for Part G - Salaries.





Reporting Staff by Occupational Category

The occupational categories in the IPEDS HR component were changed in 2012-13 to align with the occupational categories in the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) System.



Structure of the 2018 Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) System The occupations in the SOC are classified at four levels of aggregation: 23 major groups, 98 minor groups, 459 broad occupations, and 867 detailed occupations. Each lower level of detail identifies a more specific group of occupations. (For more information refer to the table at

http://www.bls.gov/soc/2018/soc_structure_2018.pdf.)

Each item in the SOC is designated by a six-digit code:

Major group codes end with 0000 (e.g., 25-0000 Education Instruction and Library Occupations) Minor group codes generally end with 000 (e.g., 25-1000 Postsecondary Teachers)

Broad occupations end with 0 (e.g., 25-4020 Librarians and Media Collections Specialists)

Detailed occupations end with a number other than 0 (e.g., 25-9044 Teaching Assistant, Postsecondary)

IPEDS does not require institutions to manually code and report all occupations at the detailed SOC level. However, although coding at the 6-digit level is not required, it can make categorization more precise and would also provide supporting documentation if there were questions about why a given job was classified in a specific IPEDS category.

Most of the occupational data in IPEDS will be collected at the higher, major 2-digit level (e.g., 11-0000 Management Occupations). However, there are a few instances where data will be collected at a lower level such as Postsecondary Teachers; Librarians, Curators, and Archivists; Library Technicians; and Graduate Assistants-Teaching. For IPEDS purposes, institutions should report their employees in the occupational categories defined in the IPEDS HR survey. The IPEDS HR occupational categories and the associated SOC codes are provided below and

at https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/resource/download/IPEDS_HR_2018_SOC_Crosswalk.pdf.





2018 SOC Classification Principles

The SOC Classification Principles form the basis on which the SOC system is structured.

1. The SOC covers all occupations in which work is performed for pay or profit, including work performed in family-operated enterprises by family members

who are not directly compensated. It excludes occupations unique to volunteers. Each occupation is assigned to only one occupational category at the lowest level of the classification.

2. Occupations are classified based on work performed and, in some cases, on the skills, education, and/or training needed to perform the work. 3. Workers primarily engaged in planning and directing of resources are classified in management occupations in Major Group 11-0000. Duties of these

workers may include supervision.

4. Supervisors of workers in Major Groups 13-0000 through 29-0000 usually have work experience and perform activities similar to those of the workers

they supervise, and therefore are classified with the workers they supervise. **

5. Workers in Major Group 31-0000 Healthcare Support Occupations assist and are usually supervised by workers in Major Group 29-0000 Healthcare

Practitioners and Technical Occupations, and therefore there are no first-line supervisor occupations in Major Group 31-0000.

6. Workers in Major Groups 33-0000 through 53-0000 whose primary duty is supervising are classified in the appropriate first-line supervisor category

because their work activities are distinct from those of the workers they supervise.

7. Apprentices and trainees are classified with the occupations for which they are being trained, while helpers and aides are classified separately because

they are not in training for the occupation they are helping.

8. If an occupation is not included as a distinct detailed occupation in the structure, it is classified in an appropriate “All Other” occupation. “All Other”

occupations are placed in the structure when it is determined that the detailed occupations comprising a broad occupation group do not account for all of the workers in the group. These occupations appear as the last occupation in the group, with a code ending in “9”, and are identified in their title by having “All Other” appear at the end.

9. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Census Bureau are charged with collecting and reporting data on total U.S. employment across the full

spectrum of SOC Major Groups. Thus, for a detailed occupation to be included in the SOC, either the Bureau of Labor Statistics or the Census Bureau must be able to collect and report data on that occupation.

** Postsecondary administrators such as Deans are classified as 11-000 Management occupations.

Additional Information from the 2018 SOC Coding Guidelines



Job Titles That Could be Coded in More than One SOC Occupational Category An employee should be reported in only one SOC occupational category.

When workers in a single job could be coded in more than one occupation, they should be coded in the occupation that requires the highest level of skill. If there is no measurable difference in skill requirements, workers should be coded in the occupation in which they spend the most time. Workers whose job is to teach at different levels (e.g., elementary, middle, or secondary) should be coded in the occupation corresponding to the highest educational level they teach.

Determining Supervisory Category for Major Groups 33-0000 through 53-000 Workers in Major Groups 33-0000 through 53-0000 who spend 80 percent or more of their time performing supervisory activities are coded in the appropriate first-line supervisor category in the SOC. In these same Major Groups (33-0000 through 53-0000), persons with supervisory duties who spend less than 80 percent of their time supervising are coded with the workers they supervise.





Comparison of the 2024-25 IPEDS HR Occupational Categories to the 2018 SOC Occupational Categories (see crosswalk below for complete information)

The IPEDS HR occupational categories and the 2018 SOC occupational categories are similar for several of the categories that directly match (e.g., 11-0000 Management Occupations).

However, they differ in three major ways:

There are 13 broad IPEDS HR occupational categories and 23 major SOC categories.

Several of the IPEDS HR occupational categories represent combinations of separate SOC categories, e.g., the HR category "Service Occupations" includes five SOC categories.

The major SOC category "Education, Training, and Library Occupations" (25-0000) is reported in the IPEDS HR survey at a more detailed level: "Postsecondary Teachers"; "Librarians, Curators, and Archivists"; "Student and Academic Affairs and Other Education Services Occupations"; and "Graduate Assistants-Teaching"

The category "Graduate Assistants-Research" does not have a single associated SOC code.

The SOC "Military Specific Occupations" (55-0000) category is not included in IPEDS reporting because the IPEDS HR component collects data on civilian staff only.

SOC category 25-1000, Postsecondary Teachers, includes the following IPEDS occupational categories:

Instructional Staff

In the HR survey component, Instructional Staff is defined as the combined category of Primarily Instruction AND Instruction Combined with Research and/or Public Service.

Primarily Instruction

Persons whose specific assignments customarily are made for the purpose of providing instruction or teaching. Regardless of title, faculty status, academic rank, or tenure status, these employees formally spend the majority of their time providing instruction or teaching. Instruction combined with research and/or public service

Persons for whom it is not possible to differentiate between instruction or teaching, research, and public service because each of these functions is an integral component of his/her regular assignment. Regardless of title, faculty status, academic rank, or tenure status, these employees formally spend the majority of their time providing instruction, research, and/or public service.





Note regarding the use of the “Postsecondary Teachers” Terminology: Postsecondary Teachers is an occupational category in the 2018 Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) Manual with the SOC code 25-1000. This category is not an IPEDS reporting category because staff generally regarded by institutions as faculty are not only instructional staff, but can be research staff and public service staff as well. Postsecondary Teachers is not a good description of these occupational categories on postsecondary campuses, and introduces confusion into the reporting done by institutions.

However, because of the requirement to align with the SOC, all three categories (instructional staff, research staff, and public service staff) are included individually under the Postsecondary Teachers category in the IPEDS Data Center, with explanations.





Reporting Graduate Assistants by Occupational Category

For IPEDS purposes, graduate assistants are considered part-time employees and should be reported on the graduate assistant screen located in the part-time section of the survey.

Listed below are the graduate assistant categories that are included in the HR survey:

Graduate Assistant - Teaching [SOC Detailed Occupation Teaching Assistants, Postsecondary 25-9044

https://www.bls.gov/soc/2018/major_groups.htm#25-0000]

Graduate students who teach one or more full courses should be classified in the 25-1000 minor group. Excludes "Teacher Assistant" (25-9042, 25-9043, and 25-9049).

Graduate Assistants in Non-Instructional Occupational Categories

Graduate assistants who primarily perform non-teaching duties, such as health care, should be reported in the occupational category related to the work performed. For example, a graduate assistant updating websites in the IT department should be reported as a graduate assistant in the IPEDS HR occupational category "Computer, Engineering, and Science Occupations".

Graduate Assistant - Research Persons whose specific assignments customarily are made for the purpose of conducting research. Graduate Assistant – Other Persons in the following former Non-Instructional Occupation Categories:

Graduate Assistant - Management

Graduate Assistant - Business and Financial Operations

Graduate Assistant - Computer, Engineering, and Science

Graduate Assistant - Community, Social Service, Legal, Arts, Design, Entertainment, Sports, and Media Graduate Assistant - Library and Student and Academic Affairs and Other Education Services Graduate Assistant - Healthcare Practitioners and Technical
