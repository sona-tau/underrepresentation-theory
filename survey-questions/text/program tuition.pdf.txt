2024-25 Survey Materials  Form



Cost I for program tuition reporters

Overview

Cost Overview

The purpose of the Cost (CST) component is to collect information on student charges for Cost of Attendance estimates and to calculate an Average Net Price (ANP) for first-time, full-time undergraduate students to meet requirements of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA), as amended. This component also collects information on tuition and fees for other groups of students.

Much of the data reported on CST appear on College Navigator, which is updated only one time after CST data have been reviewed by NCES. Therefore, any data reporting errors may stay on College Navigator for a full year.

Additionally, the ANP calculation has important implications for what students see about your institution, and also for the College Affordability and Transparency Center lists.

Data Reporting Reminder:

Report data to accurately reflect the time period corresponding with the IPEDS survey component, even if such reporting is seemingly inconsistent with prior-

year reporting.

Changes in reporting:

The following changes were made for the 2024-25 collection:

This is a new survey component that will open in the Fall to allow Cost of Attendance (COA) data to be updated on College Navigator. The component will

reopen in the Winter to collect selected information on financial aid awards to calculate an institutional Average Net Price (ANP), at which time COA data

elements can be updated or corrected.

Added questions to determine and make publicly available the information on whether postsecondary institutions ask for other financial information not on

the FAFSA form and whether they collect asset data even when students qualify for having their assets exempted from the federal need analysis as this

information required by the FAFSA Simplification Act.

Purpose of Survey Component

The purpose of the Cost (CST) component is to collect information on student changes and for Cost of Attendance and Average Net Price to meet requirements of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA), as amended. This survey also collects information on tuition and fees for other students.

Much of the data reported on CST appear on College Navigator, which is updated once after CST data have been reviewed. Thus, errors may stay on College Navigator for a full year.

Additionally, the average net price calculation has important implications for what students see about your institution, and also for the College Affordability and Transparency Center lists.





Who Must Report

Institutions that had any students enrolled during the current and/or prior academic year must report. Cost of attendance and average net price data are only required of institutions with full-time, first-time students enrolled during the current and/or prior academic year.





Changes in reporting

The following changes were made for the 2024-25 collection:

This is a new survey component that will open in the Fall to allow Cost of Attendance (COA) data to be updated on College Navigator. The component will reopen in the Winter to collect selected information on financial aid awards to calculate an institutional Average Net Price (ANP), at which time COA data elements can be updated or corrected.

Added questions to determine and make publicly available the information on whether postsecondary institutions ask for other financial information not on the FAFSA form and whether they collect asset data even when students qualify for having their assets exempted from the federal need analysis as this information required by the FAFSA Simplification Act.





General instructions

What You Will Need

There are multiple data elements required to complete this survey component. Many of these data elements should come from the institution’s financial aid office.

Application fees for applicable student types.

Cost of attendance information for full-time, first-time students.

Tuition and fee rates for applicable student types.

Food and housing charges.

Student counts for applicable student types.

Student counts by living arrangement.

Total aid dollars awarded to these students.

1. Financial aid information about the following student categories:

FTFT undergraduate students who paid the lower of in-state/in-district tuition rate and were awarded any grant/scholarship aid from the federal government, state/local government, or the institution

FTFT undergraduate students who paid the lower of in-state/in-district tuition rate and were awarded any Title IV federal student aid

2. Living arrangement information for full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who paid the lower of in-state or in-district

tuition rate and were awarded grant or scholarship aid during the reporting period

3. Living arrangement information for full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who paid the lower of in-state or in-district

tuition rate and were awarded Title IV federal student aid during the reporting period

4. Income levels for full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who paid the lower of in-state or in-district tuition rate and were

awarded Title IV federal student aid during the reporting period

About the Data

Five different types of data appear in this component. There are data:

That institutions provide about tuition, fees, food, and housing

That institutions provide from their own financial aid records

That are prior-year data, shown in red, which can be used as a comparison with the current year's data (i.e., the data that are being reported) That are preloaded from the IPEDS Fall Enrollment (EF) survey component that your institution completed in the most recent collection That are calculated from the other data elements

In the latter two cases, the data provider should check that the data that are preloaded and calculated are consistent with the data in the institution's underlying financial aid records. If the data preloaded or calculated are not consistent with the institution's records, then an error in data entry may have

https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/public/survey-materials/forms?surveyid=11&instructionid=30073&formid=73 21/31

occurred.

Context Boxes

Optional context boxes throughout the component allow institutions to provide more information regarding reported data. Note that the information in these

context boxes may be posted on the U.S. Department of Education’s College Navigator website. NCES will review entries in these context boxes for applicability

and appropriateness before posting them on College Navigator. However, institutions should ensure that entries in these context boxes are free from

grammatical and spelling errors and are written so that they can be understood by students and parents.

Interactive Edits

This component contains interactive edits that will check for blank fields, invalid values, or values that fall outside expected ranges. Some error messages will

require you to confirm or explain the values that you entered. Some error messages are fatal and will require you to contact the IPEDS Help Desk at (877)

225-2568 or ipedshelp@rti.org for resolution.



Coverage

Reporting Period

The cost of attendance and tuition and fees data are reported for the most current year, as well as 3 prior years. The financial aid data reported for this

component should be for the prior academic year as defined by the institution.

Student Cohort

For program reporters, the student cohort covered by this component includes undergraduate students enrolled in the prior academic year between July 1 and

June 31.

What to include

The following types of financial aid should be known in this component:

Title IV aid: Title IV aid includes Federal Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant, Federal Work Study (FWS), and the Subsidized and Unsubsidized Direct Loan programs. Report 100% of student FSEOG and FWS award amounts. That is, include the federal and matching share, regardless of the source of the match. Also, FSEOG and FWS award amounts should not exceed program amounts budgeted for the award year. That is, if the institution's packaging policy includes an over-awarding strategy to account for attrition to make sure all funds are expended, exclude these amounts from award amounts reported to IPEDS. Federal grants (grants/educational assistance funds): Grants provided by federal agencies such as the U.S. Department of Education, including Title IV federal student aid program grants such as Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), and Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants. Also include need-based and merit-based educational assistance funds and training vouchers provided from (a) other federal agencies and/or (b) federally- sponsored educational benefits programs.

Do not include veterans' education benefits, as defined in section 480(c) of the HEA, as they are no longer treated as Estimated Financial

Assistance (EFA) for Federal Student Aid's purposes. For more information, visit https://ifap.ed.gov/electronic-announcements/08-13-2009-

general-subject-guidance-federal-veterans-education-benefits.

Federal Work Study: Money earned by students based on financial need to meet postsecondary education costs who are employed part-time, typically in education related employment or community service activities on- campus or off-campus at the institution, or a private for-profit or nonprofit business, agency, or organization. Earnings include the federal and nonfederal share of wages, benefits, withholdings, and other employment deductions. It includes credit and non-credit employment. Examples of types of employment include, but is not limited to, assistantships, apprenticeships, internships, externships, and cooperative education experiences. While it does not include institutional and state work study programs, the non-federal share includes all state and local funds used to match these programs. See applicable federal, state, local, and institutional program rules for additional information. Federal loans to students: Money borrowed from the federal government that must be repaid for which the student is the designated borrower. This category of aid includes all Title IV federal student programs such as Subsidized Direct Loans and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. It also includes Health Professions Student Loans, Loans for Disadvantaged Students, Nursing Student Loans, and Primary Care Loans. Do not include PLUS loans and other federal loans not made directly to the student.

State/local government grants (grants/scholarships/waivers): Grants that were awarded by your state such as Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnerships (LEAP) (formerly SSIGs), the Special Leveraging Educational Assistance Program (SLEAP), the Grants for Access and Persistence (GAP) Program, and Robert C. Byrd Honors Scholarships. Include merit-based grants or scholarships that were provided by your state or local government. Also include tuition and fee waivers for which your institution was reimbursed by a state or local government agency. Institutional grants or scholarships (scholarships/waivers): Grants, scholarships, and fellowships granted and funded by the institution and/or individual departments within the institution and are limited to students attending your institution. Include scholarships targeted to certain individuals (e.g., based on state of residence, major, or participation in athletic activities) for which the institution designates the recipient. Also include institutional tuition and fee waivers for which your institution was not reimbursed by a state or local government agency. This is not intended to include Federal Work Study.

Private grants or scholarships: Grants or scholarships to students awarded and paid by an outside organization but directed through the institution's financial aid office and/or business office (e.g., Rotary Club Scholarship).

NOTE: In this component, "aid awarded" refers to grant or scholarship aid that was awarded to students. For reporting grant or scholarship aid, institutions should report on aid that was awarded to students. This amount may be different from the amount that was actually disbursed to students. For example, a student may be awarded grant or scholarship aid at the beginning of the academic year but then leave the institution before the entire amount is disbursed. In this case, institutions should report the original amount of grant or scholarship aid that was awarded.

Note also that different types of financial aid should be reported for different groups of students. Please review the instructions and the screens carefully to ensure that you are reporting the correct types of financial aid in the appropriate parts.

Institutions need to report selected financial aid information in this survey component (Section 2) such that the average net price calculations (Section 3) shown on College Navigator and used for the College Affordability and Transparency Center lists are a reflection of what students typically pay.

For total aid amounts, report to the nearest whole dollar and omit cents. For student counts, an unduplicated count should be given within a given aid category (e.g., Federal Pell Grants). However, a student can appear in more than one aid category.

What NOT to include

Do not report student counts or aid amounts for the following:

Students who were only graduate students at the institution during the reporting period

Students who were enrolled exclusively in courses not creditable toward a certificate/degree Students who were enrolled exclusively in Continuing Education Units (CEUs)

Students who were exclusively auditing classes

Do not report:

Federal Work Study amounts into any total aid amounts

Subsidized and Unsubsidized Direct Loan amounts into any total aid amounts

ROTC aid, which are excluded from estimated financial assistance, also known as EFA, in any total aid amounts

Detailed Instructions



This section provides line-by-line instructions for each part of the Cost component.



Screening questions

If you responded to questions regarding full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students in the Institutional Characteristics survey,

your institution will be required to answer all the questions.

1. Institutionally-controlled housing

Indicate if the institution provides institutionally-controlled housing (either on- or off-campus) and if so, specify the housing capacity.

2. On-campus or institutionally-controlled off-campus housing requirement

Indicate if ALL full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking students are required to live on campus or in institutionally-controlled off-campus housing. If

you answer Yes to this question, you will not be asked to report off-campus food and housing in the price of attendance. If you make ANY exceptions to

this rule, please answer No so that this does not cause conflicts with the average net price calculation. Misreporting may lead to an inaccurate average

net price calculation for your institution.

This question is a screening question and does not appear on College Navigator. Please respond correctly.

3. Food or meal plans

Indicate if the institution offers food or meal plans to students. If the institution offers fixed meal plans, provide the number of meals per week for the

maximum plan available. Institutions will be asked to report the food charges or combined food and housing charges on later screens.

4. Application fee

Indicate whether your institution charges and application fee. If you select yes, please indicate which levels have an application fee.

5. Application fee waiver

Indicate if applicants to your institution can have the application fee waived if they demonstrate financial need. If you select yes, please indicate which

levels.

6. Promise Program

Indicate if your institution participates in any Promise programs. Promise programs are residency-based scholarship programs for high school graduates at

selected postsecondary institutions. Programs may have additional requirements beyond residency and can be either a first-dollar or last-dollar benefit.

7. Number of Programs Offered

Report the total number of full programs offered by your institution (not individual courses). IPEDS defines a program as “A combination of courses and

related activities organized for the attainment of broad educational objectives as described by the institution.”

8. Asset information

Indicate whether for the purpose of awarding institutional financial aid your institution requires asset information from students who qualify for the

exemption from asset reporting on the FAFSA form.

9. Additional financial information

Indicate whether for the purpose of awarding institutional financial aid your institution requires additional financial information separate from the FAFSA

form. If yes, include a website link to where your institution’s website explains what additional financial information is required.



Section 1 – Student Charges

Part A – Application fees

[Only applicable to institutions that charge application fees]

Note, Part A will only load for institutions that indicated that they charge an application fee in the screening questions.

For each applicable student level, indicate the amount for the application fee. An application fee is the amount of money that an institution charges for

processing a student's application for admittance to the institution. This amount is not creditable toward tuition or required fees, nor is it refundable if the

student is not admitted to the institution. If different amounts are charged for a level, please provide the most frequently charged amount and you can

provide more information for students in the context box.



Part B – Cost of attendance for full-time, first-time undergraduate students [Applicable to program reporting institutions only]

Institutions with no full-time, first-time students will report the six largest programs on one page, and should follow the directions under ‘Reporting the next

5 largest programs’ to report these data. For public institutions, report the in-state or in-district costs if applicable.

Reporting the largest program by enrollment

Errors can be corrected in the Cost component in the Winter.

This question requires working with your student financial aid office.

The "largest" programs are determined by enrollment size and NOT program length. Use total enrollment size from the last reporting year, as the total

current year enrollment is unknown. Enrollment includes students enrolled for credit regardless of full-time/part-time status or if they are Title IV eligible

This section asks questions about the largest program by enrollment your institution has offered for entering students. Institutions that provided data for

the largest program in the prior year will see pre-loaded data (when CIP code has changed, you will need to update the CIP with an appropriate CIP). If the

largest program has changed, check the box provided and indicate a different program. You will be required to enter data for all 4 years as indicated on the

screen.

To enter or change the largest program

Select the CIP category code from the first drop-down box and title from the second drop-down box. If you need to restore the pre-loaded information, click the reset button at bottom of the screen.

Provide the total length of program in clock or credit hours and in weeks (as completed by a student attending full-time). Provide the total length of the academic year, as used to calculate your Pell budget, in clock or credit hours and in weeks.



https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/public/survey-materials/forms?surveyid=11&instructionid=30073&formid=73 23/31

Provide amounts for tuition and fees, books and supplies; food and housing; and other expenses FOR THE TIME PERIOD INDICATED (either for the length of the program, or for 1 month). These are the amounts used by your financial aid office for determining eligibility for student financial assistance.

Note: Programs of English as a second language and GED courses are not to be included in IPEDS. Institutions should report their largest program based

on enrollment size.

Food and Housing:

If your institution offers housing but does not offer food or meal plan, refer to your institution’s cost of attendance budgets from your financial aid office to report an estimate of how much students would spend on food.

If your institution offers food or meal plan but does not offer housing, refer to your institution’s cost of attendance budgets from your financial aid office to report an estimate of how much students would spend on housing.



Part C – Student Charges – Program Data

[in-district, in-state, and out-of-state breakdowns only applicable to institutions that indicated that the tuition varies][Levels only applicable to institutions that

have each level]

If your institution has full-time, first-time students, the largest program data will be carried forward from Part B. Report the data for the next 5 largest programs by enrollment. If your institution does not enroll full-time, first-time students, enter data for all 6 programs.

Select the CIP category code from the first drop-down box and title from the second drop-down box. If you need to restore the pre-loaded information, click the reset button at bottom of the screen.

Enter the tuition and required fees charged for the entire length of the program.

Enter the cost of books and supplies for the program, which may include course materials and equipment for some institutions. Report the full length of the program and indicate whether the length of the entire program is measured in clock or credit hours. Report the number of months it takes a full-time student to complete the program.



Part D - Food and Housing

[Applicable to degree-granting institutions with undergraduate programs that offer food and housing only]

Institutions that offer institutionally controlled housing (either on- or off- campus) will be required to answer the questions in this section.

Report the typical housing charge for the full academic year (as indicated on screen) for a full-time student sharing a room with one other student.

Report the food or meal plan charge based on the maximum meal plan available for the full academic year (as indicated on screen) to a full-time student.

Report a combined food and housing charge only if food and housing charges cannot be separated.



Section 2 – Financial Aid Data for Average Net Price Calculations

Part A - Establish Your Student Counts

Note that the data you report on this screen will be carried to other parts of the Cost survey component.

Students who only receive HEERF grants should not be included on line 02 or line 03.



Instructions:

In the fields provided, report the student counts for each student category below. Some values are preloaded from your institution’s IPEDS 12-month

Enrollment (E12) component but may be modified if necessary. If you have questions about the value that has been preloaded in this field, please contact your

institution’s IPEDS Keyholder.

Line Description

01. All full-time, first-time degree certificate-seeking undergraduate students (Editable Preload, EF)

Report the number of students who are full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates. This number will be preloaded from your institution’s IPEDS 12-month Enrollment component, but it may be modified if necessary. If you have questions about the value that has been preloaded in this field, please contact your institution’s IPEDS Keyholder.

02. Full-time, first-time degree certificate-seeking undergraduate students paying the lower of in-state or in-district

tuition rate who were awarded grant or scholarship aid from the federal government, state/local government, or the institution (Reported value)

For institutions with different tuition rates, include only those students who paid the lower of in-state or in-district tuition rate. Do not include students awarded aid from other sources only.

Of the full-time, first-time degree certificate-seeking undergraduate students on Line 01, those awarded grant or scholarship aid from the:

federal government,

state/local government, or

institution.



03. Full-time, first-time degree certificate-seeking undergraduate students paying the lower of in-state or in-district

tuition rate who were awarded any Title IV federal student aid (Reported value)

For institutions with different tuition rates, include only those students who paid the lower of in-state or in-district tuition rate.

Report students awarded any Title IV federal student aid (i.e., report students awarded Title IV federal grant aid, federal work study, or federal student loans).



Title IV federal student aid includes the following:

Federal Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant

Federal Work Study (FWS)

Subsidized and Unsubsidized Direct Loan programs

Note: Include FWS and Subsidized and Unsubsidized Direct Loan recipients in student counts but do not include

https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/public/survey-materials/forms?surveyid=11&instructionid=30073&formid=73 24/31

FWS and Subsidized and Unsubsidized Direct Loan award amounts in Part C. Report 100% of student FSEOG award amounts. That is, include the federal and matching share, regardless of the source of the match. Also, FSEOG award amounts should not exceed program amounts budgeted for the award year. That is, if the institution’s packaging policy includes an over-awarding strategy to account for attrition to make sure all funds are expended, exclude unfunded budgeted amounts from award amounts reported to IPEDS.





Part B – Student counts and aid amounts for FTFT DGCS undergraduate students enrolled in the institution’s largest program awarded grant or scholarship aid

[Instruction “lower of in-state or in-district” only applicable to institutions with varied tuition]

This part collects information about the number of full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students enrolled in the prior fall paying different tuition rates. The information is used to estimate the average net price for these students in Section 3.

Emergency grants funded under the CARES, CRRSA, and ARP Acts should NOT be included for these students under "Report the total amount of grant or scholarship aid from the federal government, state/local government, or the institution awarded to these students," as inclusion of these grants would skew average net price calculations.

Report for all full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students enrolled in the prior fall for the prior academic year as defined by the institution paying the lower of in-state or in-district tuition rate awarded grant or scholarship aid from the following sources: the federal government, state/local government, or the institution.

Do not include students awarded only grant or scholarship aid from private or other sources, awarded only non-grant aid, or awarded HEERF grants only.

In this part, you will be asked to report living arrangement information for full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students enrolled in the prior 12-month period – July 1 to June 30 for the prior academic year as defined by the institution who paid the lower of in-state or in-district tuition rate and were awarded grant or scholarship aid from the following sources: the federal government, state/local government, or the institution.

In this part, you will be asked to report living arrangement information for full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students enrolled in the prior 12-month period of July 1 – June 30 who paid the lower of in-state or in-district tuition rate and were awarded grant or scholarship aid from the following sources: the federal government, state/local government, or the institution. Living arrangement is no longer included on the Free

Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Institutions can still ask about the students about their living arrangements in other ways, such as adding a question to an existing application or creating a form or application to get the answer of the student’s living arrangements. The institution cannot, however, require any additional forms in order for the student to receive aid.

Institutions should use the most recently available information regarding student living arrangements. While there is an unknown option, if the institution knows the living arrangement for the student, then the student should be reported in the appropriate category.



Include the following types of aid awarded any time during the prior academic year:

Grant or scholarship aid from the federal government, state/local government, and the institution Do not include grant or scholarship aid from private or other sources, PLUS loans or loans made to anyone other than the student, OR Federal Work Study amounts

Instructions:

In the fields provided, report the number of full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students enrolled in the prior 12-month period of July 1 – June 30 for the prior academic year as defined by the institution who paid the lower of in-state or in-district tuition rate and were awarded grant or scholarship aid from the following sources: the federal government, state/local government, or the institution with each type of living arrangement and the total amount of grant or scholarship aid from the federal government, state/local government, or the institution awarded to these students.

In this part, you will be asked to report living arrangement information for full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students enrolled in

the prior 12-month period of July 1 – June 30 who paid the lower of in-state or in-district tuition rate and were awarded grant or scholarship aid from the

following sources: the federal government, state/local government, or the institution. Living arrangement is no longer included on the Free Application for

Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Institutions can still ask about the students about their living arrangements in other ways, such as adding a question to an

existing application or creating a form or application to get the answer of the student’s living arrangements. The institution cannot, however, require any

additional forms in order for the student to receive aid.

Institutions should use the most recently available information regarding student living arrangements. While there is an unknown option, if the institution

knows the living arrangement for the student, then the student should be reported in the appropriate category.



Report all students awarded Title IV federal student aid. Title IV federal student aid includes the following:

Federal Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant

Federal Work Study (FWS)

Subsidized and Unsubsidized Direct Loan programs.

Note: Include FWS and Subsidized and Unsubsidized Direct Loan recipients in student counts but do not include FWS and Subsidized and

Unsubsidized Direct Loan award amounts. Report 100% of student FSEOG award amounts. That is, include the federal and matching share, regardless of

the source of the match. Also, FSEOG award amounts should not exceed program amounts budgeted for the award year. That is, if the institution’s packaging

policy includes an over-awarding strategy to account for attrition to make sure all funds are expended, exclude unfunded budgeted amounts from award

amounts reported to IPEDS.

For institutions with different tuition rates, include only those students who paid the lower of in-state or in-district tuition rate.

As required by the HEA, as amended (2008), the average net price for these students will be posted on College Navigator. In addition, the average net price calculated for this group will be used in the U.S. Department of Education’s College Affordability and Transparency Center lists.

The components used to estimate the average net price include the average total cost of attendance and the average grant or scholarship aid awarded to full-time, first-time students. The total cost of attendance is the sum of tuition and required fees (Line 01), books and supplies (Line 02) and the weighted average by living arrangement for food and housing, and other expenses (Lines 10). Information about cost of attendance is carried forward from Section 1 (prior year reporting). If you did not enter this information and have questions about the values entered here, contact your institution’s IPEDS Keyholder.
