https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/public/survey-materials/forms?surveyid=6&instructionid=30051&formid=51 5/29 Part A - Fall Enrollment- Gender Unknown or Another Gender than Provided Categories

Reporting Reminders:

The purpose of this supplemental section is to determine whether institutions are able to report the number of students for whom gender is unknown and the number of students for whom gender does not align with the 'Men' and 'Women' categories. Note that these students must still be allocated into the 'Men' and 'Women' categories in all other sections of the survey component.

Institutions should not ask students that do not select a binary gender to allocate themselves to a binary gender category; it is up to the institution to allocate unknown students and students that indicate another gender into the binary categories throughout the forms where required. One method commonly used by institutions is to allocate these students to the binary categories required in other parts of the form using the proportion of men to women reported. The 'gender unknown' category is to report students for whom the institution does not know a gender.

Is your institution able to report another gender for the Fall 2024 reporting period?

If you indicate 'No, my institution is not able to report another gender,' leave the cells in the rows for 'Another gender' blank (i.e., do not report 0). If you indicate 'No, some cells will have a value of less than 5 students,' your institution collects data on another gender, but some cells have a value of less than 5 students, do not report the data and leave the cells in the rows for 'Another gender' blank. If you indicate 'Yes', but no students identified as another gender, please enter '0'.

Undergraduate students:

No, my institution is not able to report another gender (do not report)

No, some cells will have a value of less than 5 students (do not report)

Yes

https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/public/survey-materials/forms?surveyid=6&instructionid=30051&formid=51 14/29 Part E - First-Time Student Cohort Retention Rates (Full-time)





Retention Rates - Full-time, First-time certificate-seeking Cohort from Fall 2023




Academic reporters report retention data as of the institution's official fall reporting date or as of October 15. Program reporters determine the cohort with enrollment any time between August 1 and October 31, 2023 and retention based on August 1, 2024.

The retention rate is calculated by the system after clicking "Save" on the screen. Exclusions are subtracted from the original cohort and the resulting adjusted cohort is used for calculating the retention rate.

Retention Data Reporting Reminders:

Include only full-time, first-time certificate-seeking students in this cohort.

Determine full-time using Fall 2023 attendance status (e.g., if a student was full-time in Fall 2023, report them in the full-time cohort regardless of Fall 2024

status).

If there are no students to report in the cohort, enter zero. Do not leave the field blank.

Report in the exclusions box (line E2a) the number of students from the cohort who left the institution for any of the following reasons: died or were totally

and permanently disabled; to serve in the armed forces (including those called to active duty); to serve with a foreign aid service of the Federal Government

(e.g., Peace Corps); or to serve on official church missions.

Report in the inclusion box (line E2b) first-time certificate-seeking study abroad students who were excluded from the first-time cohort (line E1) but who have

re-enrolled at the institution their second year.

Retention Rates - Part-time, First-time certificate-seeking Cohort from Fall 2023




Academic reporters report retention data as of the institution's official fall reporting date or as of October 15. Program reporters determine the cohort with enrollment any time between August 1 and October 31, 2023 and retention based on August 1, 2024.

The retention rate is calculated by the system after clicking "Save" on the screen. Exclusions are subtracted from the original cohort and the resulting adjusted cohort is used for calculating the retention rate.

Retention Data Reporting Reminders:

Include only part-time, first-time certificate-seeking students in this cohort. Determine part-time using Fall 2023 attendance status (e.g., if a student was part-time in Fall 2023, report them in the part-time cohort regardless of their Fall 2024 status).

If there are no students to report in the cohort, enter zero. Do not leave the field blank.

Report in the exclusions box (line E7a) the number of students from the cohort who left the institution for any of the following reasons: died or were totally and permanently disabled; to serve in the armed forces (including those called to active duty); to serve with a foreign aid service of the Federal Government (e.g., Peace Corps); or to serve on official church missions.

Report in the inclusion box (line E7b) first-time certificate-seeking study abroad students who were excluded from the first-time cohort (line E6) but who have re-enrolled at the institution their second year.
