1. Which instructional activity units will you use to report undergraduate instructional activity?

Undergraduate instructional activity data in Part B may be reported in units of clock hours or credit hours. Please note that any graduate level instructional activity must be reported in credit hours. (4-year institutions only)

Clock hours

Credit hours

Both clock and credit hours (some undergraduate programs measured in clock hours and some measured in credit hours)



You may use the box below to provide additional context for the data you have reported above. Context notes will be posted on the College Navigator website.

Therefore, you should write all context notes using proper grammar (e.g., complete sentences with punctuation) and common language that can be easily understood by students and parents (e.g., spell out acronyms).



2. Did your institution enroll high school students in college courses for credit during the 12-month Enrollment (E12) reporting period of July 1, 2023 - June 30, 2024?

If you answer Yes to this question, you will be able to report the unduplicated count of high school students enrolled in college courses for credit on Part C of the 12-month Enrollment (E12) survey component.

Yes.

Within a dual enrollment program.

Outside a dual enrollment program.

No



Note:

Within a dual enrollment program is defined as within an organized system with special guidelines that allows high school students to take college-level courses. The guidelines might have to do with entrance or eligibility requirements, funding, limits on course taking, etc. Outside a dual enrollment program is defined as high school students who simply enroll in credit courses through your institution, and are treated as regularly enrolled college students.

12-month Unduplicated Count by Gender Unknown or Another Gender than Provided Categories

Reporting Reminders:

The purpose of this supplemental section is to determine whether institutions are able to report the number of students for whom gender is unknown and the

number of students for whom gender does not align with the 'Men' and 'Women' categories. Note that these students must still be allocated into the 'Men' and

'Women' categories in all other sections of the survey component.

Institutions should not ask students that do not select a binary gender to allocate themselves to a binary gender category; it is up to the institution to allocate

unknown students and students that indicate another gender into the binary categories throughout the forms where required. One method commonly used by

institutions is to allocate these students to the binary categories required in other parts of the form using the proportion of men to women reported.

The 'gender unknown' category is to report students for whom the institution does not know a gender.

Is your institution able to report another gender for the July 1, 2023 - June 30, 2024 reporting period? If you indicate 'No, my institution is not able to report another gender,' leave the cells in the rows for 'Another gender' blank (i.e., do not report 0). If you indicate 'No, some cells will have a value of less than 5 students,' your institution collects data on another gender, but some cells have a value of less than 5 students, do not report the data and leave the cells in the rows for 'Another gender' blank. If you indicate 'Yes', but no students identified as another gender, please enter '0'.

Undergraduate students:

No, my institution is not able to report another gender (do not report)

No, some cells will have a value of less than 5 students (do not report)

Yes



Graduate students:

No, my institution is not able to report another gender (do not report)

No, some cells will have a value of less than 5 students (do not report)

Yes



Of the total students reported, how many students did you allocate to a binary gender category (Men/Women) because their gender was unknown or another gender than the provided categories?

Instructional Activity Reporting Reminder:

Instructional activity is used to calculate an IPEDS FTE based on the institution’s reported calendar system.

Graduate credit hour activity should not include any doctor’s – professional practice activity, the total of those students’ FTE is entered separately instead. FTE Reporting Reminder:

Institutions need not report their own calculations of undergraduate or graduate FTE unless IPEDS FTE calculations would be misleading for comparison

purposes among all IPEDS reporting institutions.

12-month Unduplicated Count of Dual Enrolled Students


July 1, 2023 – June 30, 2024

Reporting Reminders:

The number of high school students enrolled in college courses for credit was reported in Part A as part of the non-degree/non-certificate-seeking

unduplicated enrollment.

The number of high school students enrolled in college courses for credit reported in Part C will have some duplication with the non-degree/non-

certificate-seeking enrollment students reported in Part A.

The number of high school students enrolled in college courses for credit reported in Part C should be less than the number of non-degree/non-

certificate-seeking students reported in Part A unless all these students at your institution are high school students enrolled in college courses for

credit.

Report Hispanic/Latino individuals of any race as Hispanic/Latino

Report race for non-Hispanic/Latino individuals only

12-Month Enrollment Component Summary


The purpose of this summary is to provide you an opportunity to view some of the data that, when accepted through the IPEDS quality control process, will appear

on the College Navigator website and/or your institution’s Data Feedback Report (DFR). In addition, all data reported in IPEDS survey components become publicly

available through the IPEDS Use the Data and appear as aggregated statistics in various Department of Education reports. College Navigator is updated

approximately three months after the data collection period closes and DFRs will be available through the IPEDS Use the Data and sent to your institution’s CEO at the end of 2025.

Please review your data for accuracy. If you have questions about the data displayed below or after reviewing the data reported on the survey screens, please
