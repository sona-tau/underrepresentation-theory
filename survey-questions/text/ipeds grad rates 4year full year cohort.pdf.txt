Graduation Rates for 4-year institutions reporting on a full-year cohort (program reporters)

Overview

Graduation Rates Overview

Welcome to the IPEDS Graduation Rates (GR) survey component. The GR component collects data on the cohort of full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students and tracks their completion status at 150% of the normal time to complete all requirements of their program of study. This information is collected to assist institutions in complying with the requirements of the Student Right-to-Know Act.

Data Reporting Reminders

Report data to accurately reflect the time period corresponding with the IPEDS survey component, even if such reporting is seemingly inconsistent with prior-year reporting.

Once a student is in the cohort, they remain in the cohort, even if their status changes to part-time or they drop out or transfer out of the institution. However, adjustments can be made to the cohort for allowable exclusions, which include the death of a student, total and permanent disability, military deployment, or service on an official church mission or with a foreign aid service of the Federal government.



When reporting award levels for sub-baccalaureate certificates, determine program length by the number of credit or clock hours, NOT the academic year length in parentheses. The academic year length is meant only to provide context.

Changes to reporting for 2024-25:

The following changes were implemented for the 2024-25 data collection period:

Removed the Gender Unknown or Another Gender than Provided Categories question.



If you have questions about completing this survey, please contact the IPEDS Help Desk at 1-877-225-2568.

Establishing cohorts

Based on your institution's response to the predominant calendar system question (Section 1 - Part B, Question 4) on the Institutional Characteristics survey component from the IPEDS Fall 2024 data collection,

Your institution reported to the GR survey component as having the following number of students who did not complete, Full-Year Cohort (September 1, 2018 -but were still enrolled at your institution: August 31, 2019)

A fall cohort is used by institutions with standard academic terms (semester, trimester, quarter, 4-1-4). A full-year cohort is used by institutions offering primarily occupational/vocational programs and operating on a continuous basis.

Reporting Reminder:

Report Hispanic/Latino individuals of any race as Hispanic/Latino

Report race for non-Hispanic/Latino individuals only

NOTE: Reporting using the new race/ethnicity categories is now mandatory. On this screen you will need to establish your 2018 cohort of full-time, first-time

degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students using the new race/ethnicity categories. For information and assistance with this, please visit the IPEDS

Race/Ethnicity Information Center.

The second question is whether the respondent is from one or more races from the following list: American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and White. Institutions should allow students and staff to self-identify their race and ethnicity. For further details on the guidance for collecting these data, please see the full Federal Register notice.

Method of reporting aggregate data - Institutions must report aggregate data to the U.S. Department of Education using the NINE categories below. Racial/ethnic designations are requested only for United States citizens, residents, and other eligible non-citizens. Eligible noncitizens include all students who completed high school or a GED equivalency within the United States (including DACA and undocumented students) and who were not on an F-1 non-immigrant student visa at the time of high school graduation. More information about other eligible (for financial aid purposes) non-citizens is available at

Do not include DACA, undocumented, or other eligible noncitizens in this category. NOTE - U.S. Nonresidents are to be reported separately, in the boxes provided, rather than included in any of the seven racial/ethnic categories. Race and ethnicity unknown - This category is used only if the person did not select EITHER a racial or ethnic designation.





Section I – Establishing Cohorts

Cohort Type

The method used to report graduation rates data on this survey is predetermined by your institution's response to the predominant calendar system question (Part B, Question 4) on the IC survey component of the IPEDS Fall 2024 data collection, according to the following rules:

Institutions that offer a predominant number of programs based on standard academic terms (semesters, trimesters, quarters, or 4-1-4 plan) will report using a fall cohort of students. Institutions may use October 15, 2018 or the institution's official fall reporting date to determine the cohort. This should be the same reporting date used for the IPEDS Fall Enrollment survey.

Institutions that do not offer a predominant number of programs based on standard academic terms (as defined above) will report using a full-year cohort. These institutions must count as entering students all those students who entered the institution between September 1, 2018 and August 31, 2019, and who were enrolled for at least 15 days in a program of up to and including one year in length; or 30 days in a program of greater than one year in length.

Establishing your Cohorts

Report each student only once.

Please complete all of Section I. Screens for Sections II and III will be generated based on the data reported in Section I.

Initial cohort - If you are reporting on a fall cohort, the information reported on full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate student enrollment at your institution on the 2018 IPEDS Fall Enrollment survey will be preloaded in this column. If you did not respond to that survey, or if you are reporting on a full-year cohort, the column will be blank.

Revised cohort (Column 01) - Institutions have the option of revising their preloaded cohort if:

there are eligible students who were omitted in the past

students were reported who did not belong in the cohort (e.g., they were not actually first-time, or full-time) better information regarding race/ethnicity or gender is available for eligible students

Please review the data in the Initial cohort column (if applicable) and re-enter the cohort data in the Revised cohort column according to the 1997 racial/ethnic categories, making any necessary corrections for omissions, erroneous reporting, or where better information regarding race/ethnicity or gender is available. If your data do not appear in the Initial cohort column, please provide the enrollment data as requested in the Revised cohort column.



Establishing Subcohorts

For 4-year institutions, the cohort is divided into two subcohorts: (1) those students who upon entry are seeking a bachelor's or equivalent degree, and (2) those students who upon entry are seeking an undergraduate award other than a bachelor's degree. Institutions that do not determine degree intent upon entry should report all students as if they are bachelor's degree-seeking.

Bachelor's or equivalent degree-seeking subcohort (Column 02) –Of the revised cohort of students listed in Column 1, indicate the number of these students who declared intent to seek a bachelor's or equivalent degree upon entry. As indicated above, this should also include any students whose intent was not known. These data will be carried forward to Section II.

Other degree/certificate-seeking subcohort (Column 03) –This column represents the difference between the Revised cohort (Column 1) and the Bachelor's or equivalent degree-seeking subcohort (Column 2). The values in this column are calculated for you, and represent the number of students who declared intent to seek an undergraduate award other than a bachelor's level degree (e.g., an associate's degree or other recognized postsecondary credential) upon entry. These data will be carried forward to Section III.

Section II – Completers within 150% - Bachelor’s or Equivalent Degree-Seeking Subcohort Report each student only once.



Report the status of the 2018 subcohort of bachelor’s or equivalent degree-seeking students as of 150% of normal time to completion or August 31, 2024 (whichever was earlier) in terms of the number of completers by type of program completed. Report all students by race/ethnicity and gender.

Report only for full-time, first-time students who were seeking a bachelor’s or equivalent degree upon entry. Do NOT include part-time students, students who transferred into your institution, or students who changed their program of study to a bachelor's level degree after their first semester.

Count completers only once and indicate the highest award level attained.

SPECIAL NOTE: In order to resolve a potential conflict between transfers-out and the mission of particular programs to prepare students for transfer to other institutions, institutions may count as completers those students who have successfully completed a transfer-preparatory program. Transfer-preparatory program is defined in 34 CFR Student Assistance General Provisions, Section 668.8(b)(1)(ii) as "the successful completion of at least a 2-year program that is acceptable for full credit toward a bachelor’s degree and qualifies a student for admission into the third year of a bachelor’s degree program." The Secretary considers this the equivalent of an associate’s degree, thus completers of transfer-preparatory programs (although they do not receive a "recognized postsecondary credential") should be counted as completers of an at least 2 but less than 4 year program.

Similarly, institutions may count as completers those students who have successfully completed the first three years of a 3-2 program and are eligible to enter another institution to complete the program (provided the program is acceptable for full credit towards a five-year bachelor's degree, and qualifies a student for admission into the fourth year of a five-year bachelor's degree program). As with a transfer-preparatory program, these students should be counted as completers of an at least 2 but less than 4 year program.

In order to calculate a graduation rate that complies with Student Right-to-Know regulations, institutions may count as completers only those students who received their degree/certificate (or completed a transfer-preparatory program) within 150% of the normal time for program completion (normal time to completion is the amount of time necessary to complete all requirements for a program according to the institution's catalog). Do not count as completers students who receive their degree from another institution.

Note that completers should be reported in terms of the type of program completed, as defined by award level. For programs that are defined in terms of clock or credit hours, the program type may not be indicative of the actual calendar time a program takes to complete. For more information on program types, please consult the IPEDS Glossary.

Bachelor's or equivalent degree-seeking subcohort (Column 10) - The data in this column are carried forward from Section I for your reference.

Completers of programs of less than 2 academic years (or equivalent) (Column 11) - Enter the number of students in the bachelor's or equivalent degree-seeking subcohort who completed programs of less than 2 full-time equivalent academic years within 150% of normal time to completion. This includes awards, certificates, or diplomas of less than one academic year and of at least one but less than two academic years; or designed for completion in less than 60 semester or trimester credit hours, less than 90 quarter credit hours, or less than 1,800 clock hours. Completers of programs of at least 2 but less than 4 academic years (or equivalent) (Column 12) - Enter the number of students in the bachelor's or equivalent degree-seeking subcohort who completed programs of at least 2 but less than 4 full-time equivalent academic years within 150% of normal time to completion. This includes awards, certificates, or diplomas of at least two but less than four academic years - or designed for completion in at least 60 but less than 120 semester or trimester credit hours, at least 90 but less than 180 quarter credit hours, or at least 1,800 but less than 3,600 clock hours -and associate's degrees.

Completers of bachelor's or equivalent degrees (Column 18) - Enter the number of students in the bachelor's or equivalent degree-seeking subcohort who completed a bachelor’s degree or equivalent program within 150% of normal time to completion. Note: Completers of 3-year bachelor’s degree programs should only be included if they completed the program within 4-1/2 years.

Total completers within 150% (Column 29) - This column is the sum of the previous three columns, and is calculated for you by the data collection system.





Section II – Bachelor’s Completers by Length of Time to Degree

Report each student only once.

Of those students in the bachelor's or equivalent degree-seeking subcohort who completed a bachelor's degree or equivalent program within 150% of normal time to completion you must provide additional information on the length of time it took them to complete their program. Include all baccalaureate level degrees, including 5-year bachelor's/cooperative programs and those bachelor's degrees in which the normal 4 years of work are completed in 3 years. Of the total number of completers of bachelor's or equivalent degrees within 150% of normal time listed in Column 18, provide the following breakout:

Completed the program in 4 yrs or less (Column 19) - Enter the number of students who completed a bachelor's degree or equivalent in 4 years or less. This should include all students who completed a bachelor's degree or equivalent by August 31, 2022.

Completed the program in 5 yrs (Column 20) - Enter the number of students who completed a bachelor's degree or equivalent in 5 years. This should include all students who completed a bachelor's degree or equivalent in the period from September 1, 2022 through August 31, 2023. Do NOT include students who completed their program in 4 years or less in this column.

Completed the program in 6 yrs (Column 21) - This column represents the difference between the number of completers of bachelor's degrees or equivalent within 150% of normal time (Column 18) and the sum of those who completed their program in 4 years or less (Column 19) and those who completed their program in 5 years (Column 20). This should include all students who completed a bachelor's degree or equivalent in the period from September 1, 2023 through August 31, 2024. This column is calculated for you by the data collection system.





Section II – Non-completers - Bachelor’s or Equivalent Degree-Seeking Subcohort

Report each student only once.

Report the status of the non-completers from the 2018 subcohort of bachelor’s or equivalent degree-seeking students as of 150% of the normal time to completion for their program or August 31, 2024 (whichever was earlier). Report all students by race/ethnicity and gender.

Report only for full-time, first-time students who were seeking a bachelor's or equivalent degree upon entry. Do NOT include part-time students, students who transferred into your institution, or students who changed their program of study to a bachelor's level degree after their first semester.

Bachelor's or equivalent degree-seeking subcohort (Column 10) – The data in this column are carried forward from Section I for your reference. Total completers within 150% (Column 29) - The data in this column are carried forward from page 1 of Section II for your reference.

Total transfer-out students (Column 30) - If the mission of your institution includes providing substantial preparation for students to enroll in another eligible institution without having completed a program, you must report the total number of students who transferred out of your institution (without earning a degree/award) within 150% of normal time to completion. Include students who transferred out of your institution and subsequently re-enrolled at another eligible institution. If it is not part of your mission, you may still report transfer-out data if you wish.



https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/public/survey-materials/forms?surveyid=4&instructionid=30055&formid=57 19/25 Total exclusions (Column 45)- Indicate the total number of students who left your institution within 150% of normal time to completion for their program (and have neither graduated nor transferred to another institution) due to one of the following documented reasons:

a. The student is deceased or is totally and permanently disabled and thus unable to return to school. b. The student left school to serve in the armed forces or was called up to active duty. (Do NOT include students already in the military who transfer to

another duty station.)

c. The student left school to serve with a foreign aid service of the Federal Government, such as the Peace Corps. d. The student left school to serve on an official church mission.

NOTE: Students who leave the institution for one of the reasons noted above, but return prior to the status date of August 31, 2024, may still be subtracted/excluded from the cohort during the calculation of graduation rates.

Still enrolled (Column 51) - Enter the number of students who were still enrolled at your institution as of 150% of normal time to completion for their program (or August 31, 2024 if 150% of normal time to completion had not elapsed by that time).

No longer enrolled (Column 52) - This column represents the difference between the bachelor's or equivalent degree-seeking subcohort (Column 10) and the sum of Columns 29, 30, 45, and 51. This column should include students who graduated from their program after 150% of normal time to completion elapsed.





Section II – Bachelor’s or equivalent degree-seeking cohort - Graduation Rate for Pell recipients and recipients of a

subsidized Direct Loan who did not receive a Pell Grant

Report each student only once.

Report the status of the 2018 subcohort of bachelor’s or equivalent degree-seeking students as of 150% of normal time to completion or August 31, 2024 (whichever was earlier) in terms of the number of completers.

Report only for full-time, first-time students who were seeking a bachelor’s or equivalent degree upon entry. Do NOT include part-time students, students who transferred into your institution, or students who changed their program of study to a bachelor's level degree after their first semester.

SPECIAL NOTE: In order to resolve a potential conflict between transfers-out and the mission of particular programs to prepare students for transfer to other institutions, institutions may count as completers those students who have successfully completed a transfer-preparatory program.

Transfer-preparatory program is defined in 34 CFR Student Assistance General Provisions, Section 668.8(b)(1)(ii) as "the successful completion of at least a 2-year program that is acceptable for full credit toward a bachelor’s degree and qualifies a student for admission into the third year of a bachelor’s degree program." The Secretary considers this the equivalent of an associate’s degree, thus completers of transfer-preparatory programs (although they do not receive a "recognized postsecondary credential") should be counted as completers of an at least 2 but less than 4 year program.

Similarly, institutions may count as completers those students who have successfully completed the first three years of a 3-2 program and are eligible to enter another institution to complete the program (provided the program is acceptable for full credit towards a five-year bachelor's degree, and qualifies a student for admission into the fourth year of a five-year bachelor's degree program). As with a transfer-preparatory program, these students should be counted as completers of an at least 2 but less than 4 year program.

In order to calculate a graduation rate that complies with Student Right-to-Know regulations, institutions may count as completers only those students who received their degree/certificate (or completed a transfer-preparatory program) within 150% of the normal time for program completion (normal time to completion is the amount of time necessary to complete all requirements for a program according to the institution's catalog). Do not count as completers students who receive their degree from another institution.

For each of two different subcohorts - Bachelor's or equivalent degree-seeking students and Other degree/certificate-seeking students, data will be collected on those students who were recipients of a Pell Grant and those students who were recipients of a subsidized Direct Loan that did not receive a Pell Grant.

Recipients are defined as those students receiving and using their Pell Grant or Subsidized Direct loan. These students must receive and use the award within their first year at the institution. If the student is a recipient of an award at a later point, they would not be included in one of the subcohorts.

Number of students in the cohort - The number of students in the bachelor's or equivalent degree-seeking subcohort will be preloaded from Section 1 of the GR form. Of those students, report the number of students who received a Pell Grant and the number of students who received a subsidized Direct Loan but DID NOT receive a Pell Grant. These two categories() will be mutually exclusive. The total of these two subcohorts must be less than or equal to the total of all students.

Total exclusions - The number of exclusions in the bachelor's or equivalent degree-seeking subcohort will be preloaded from Section II of the GR form. Of those students reported as exclusions, report the number of students who received a Pell Grant and the number of students who received a subsidized Direct Loan but DID NOT receive a Pell Grant. These two categories will be mutually exclusive. The total of these two subcohorts must be less than or equal to the total of all students.

Completed bachelor's degree or equivalent within 150% - The number of students in the bachelor's or equivalent degree-seeking subcohort who completed a bachelor’s degree or equivalent program within 150% of normal time to completion will be preloaded from Section II of the GR form. Of those students reported as completers, report the number of students who received a Pell Grant and the number of students who received a subsidized Direct Loan but DID NOT receive a Pell Grant. This must be less than or equal to the Completers within 150% of normal time. The total of these two subcohorts must be less than or equal to the total of all students.

Total completers within 150% of normal time - The total number of students who completed their program within 150% of normal time to completion will be preloaded from Section II of the GR form. Of those students reported as completers, report the number of students who received a Pell Grant and the number of students who received a subsidized Direct Loan but DID NOT receive a Pell Grant. These two categories will be mutually exclusive. The total of these two subcohorts must be less than or equal to the total of all students.





Section III – Completers within 150% - Other Degree/Certificate-Seeking Subcohort

Report each student only once.

Report the status of the 2018 subcohort of students seeking other than a bachelor's degree as of 150% of normal time to completion or August 31, 2024 (whichever was earlier) in terms of the number of completers by type of program completed. Report all students by race/ethnicity and gender.

Report only for full-time, first-time students who were seeking undergraduate degrees or certificates other than a bachelor’s degree upon entry (within entering year). Do NOT include part-time students, students who transferred into your institution, or students who changed their program of study from a bachelor's level degree after the first semester.

Count completers only once and indicate the highest award level attained.

These two categories will be mutually exclusive. The total of these two subcohorts must be less than or equal to the total of all students.





Calculation of Graduation and Transfer-out Rates

Worksheets

Worksheets calculating the Student Right-To-Know and overall four-year average completion/graduation and transfer-out rates of full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students for the 2018 student cohort are provided as a convenience to the institution. In addition, the 4-year, 5-year, and 6-year graduation rates for the 2018 bachelor's or equivalent degree-seeking subcohort are provided for those institutions that are able to report bachelor's or equivalent completers by length of time to degree. Data previously reported by the institution are preloaded for use in these calculations.

Note that certain information from these worksheets will be displayed on College Navigator, as noted. Additional information relevant to the calculated rates may be entered in the context box provided, and will also be displayed on College Navigator.

Privacy Issues With Disclosure

Before using the worksheets for disclosure, please consider the following:

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 as amended (1998) (FERPA) requires that institutions not disclose information where students could be identified.

Term Definition

The result of removing any allowable exclusions from a cohort (or subcohort). For the Fall Enrollment component, it is the

cohort for calculating retention rate; for the Graduation Rates component, this is the cohort from which graduation and transfer-

Adjusted cohort

out rates are calculated; and for the Outcome Measures component, these are the four cohorts (first-time, full-time; first-time, part-time; non-first-time, full-time; or non-first-time, part-time) for which outcomes rates are calculated at 4, 6, and 8 years.

American Indian or Alaska A person having origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America) who maintains Native cultural identification through tribal affiliation or community attachment.

A person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian Subcontinent, including, for

Asian

example, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam.

Associate's degree An award that normally requires at least 2 but less than 4 years of full-time equivalent college work.

An award (baccalaureate or equivalent degree, as determined by the Secretary, U.S. Department of Education) that normally

requires at least 4 but not more than 5 years of full-time equivalent college-level work. This includes all bachelor's degrees

Bachelor's degree conferred in a 5-year cooperative (work-study) program. A cooperative plan provides for alternate class attendance and

employment in business, industry, or government; thus, it allows students to combine actual work experience with their college studies. Also includes bachelor's degrees in which the normal 4 years of work are completed in 3 years.

Bachelor's or equivalent

In the GR component of IPEDS, a cohort of students who were seeking a bachelor's or equivalent degree upon entry.

degree-seeking subcohort

Black or African American A person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa.

Cohort A specific group of students established for tracking purposes.

Cohort year The year that a cohort of students begins attending college.

Completers within 150% of

Students who completed their program within 150% of the normal (or expected) time for completion.

normal time

Students enrolled in courses for credit who are seeking a degree, certificate, or other recognized postsecondary credential. This includes students who:

- received any type of federal financial aid, regardless of what courses they took at any time;

Degree/certificate-seeking - received any state or locally based financial aid with an eligibility requirement that the student be enrolled in a degree, students (DCGS) certificate, or transfer-seeking program; or

- obtained a student visa to study at a U.S. postsecondary institution

High school students also enrolled in postsecondary courses for credit are not considered degree/certificate-seeking.

Those students who may be removed (deleted) from a cohort (or subcohort). For the Graduation Rates, Outcome Measures,

and Fall Enrollment retention rate reporting, students may be removed from a cohort if they left the institution for one of the

Exclusions

following reasons: death or total and permanent disability; service in the armed forces (including those called to active duty); service with a foreign aid service of the federal government, such as the Peace Corps; or service on official church missions.

The group of students entering in the fall term established for tracking purposes. For the Graduation Rates component, this

Fall cohort includes all students who enter an institution as full-time, first-time degree or certificate-seeking undergraduate students during

the fall term of a given year.

A student who has no prior postsecondary experience (except as noted below) attending any institution for the first time at the

First-time student undergraduate level. This includes students enrolled in academic or occupational programs. It also includes students enrolled

(undergraduate) in the fall term who attended college for the first time in the prior summer session, and students who entered with advanced

standing (college credits or recognized postsecondary credential earned before graduation from high school).

Undergraduate: A student enrolled for 12 or more semester credits, or 12 or more quarter credits, or 24 or more clock hours a week each term. Graduate: A student enrolled for 9 or more semester credits, or 9 or more quarter credits, or a student involved

Full-time student

in thesis or dissertation preparation that is considered full-time by the institution. Doctor's degree - Professional practice - full-time as defined by the institution.

This is a group of students entering at any time during the 12-month period for tracking and reporting. For Graduation Rate (GR),

a full-year cohort is from September 1 through August 31 and is used primarily by institutions that offer occupational programs

Full-year cohort of varying lengths. Students must be full-time and first-time to be considered in the cohort. For Outcome Measures (OM)

component, all degree-granting institutions report on a full-year cohort from July 1 through June 30. Students are reported once in one of the four OM cohorts: first-time, full-time; first-time, part-time: non-first-time, full-time; or non-first-time, part-time.

The rate required for disclosure and/or reporting purposes under Student Right-to-Know Act. This rate is calculated as the total

Graduation rate

number of completers within 150% of normal time divided by the revised adjusted cohort.

Graduation Rates (GR) This annual component of IPEDS was added in 1997 to help institutions satisfy the requirements of the Student Right-to-Know

legislation. Data are collected on the number of students entering the institution as full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students in a particular year (cohort), by race/ethnicity and gender; the number completing their program within 150 percent of normal time to completion; the number that transfer to other institutions if transfer is part of the institution's mission. Prior to 2007, institutions who offered athletically-related student aid were asked to report, by sport, the number of students receiving aid and whether they completed within 150 percent of normal time to completion. Now, these

https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/public/survey-materials/forms?surveyid=4&instructionid=30055&formid=57 23/25

institutions only need to report a URL where the athletic data is located on their website, when available. GR automatically generates worksheets that calculate rates, including average rates over 4 years.

Hispanic/Latino A person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race.

A specific group of individuals established for tracking purposes. For the Graduation Rates (GR) and Outcome Measures (OM)

components of IPEDS, the initial cohort is defined as the enrollment count before removing revisions and exclusions of all

degree/certificate-seeking students who enter in either (1) the fall term of a given academic year, or (2) between September 1st

Initial cohort

and August 31st of the following year. For the GR component of IPEDS, the initial cohort is only for full-time, first-time students. For OM, all undergraduates are placed in one of four initial cohorts: full-time, first-time; part-time, first-time; full-time, non-first-time; and part-time, non-first time.

The Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), conducted by the NCES, began in 1986 and involves annual

institution-level data collections. All postsecondary institutions that have a Program Participation Agreement with the Office of

Integrated Postsecondary Postsecondary Education (OPE), U.S. Department of Education (throughout IPEDS referred to as "Title IV") are required to report

Education Data System data using a web-based data collection system. IPEDS currently consists of the following components: Institutional

(IPEDS) Characteristics (IC); 12-month Enrollment (E12);Completions (C); Admissions (ADM); Student Financial Aid (SFA); Human

Resources (HR) composed of Employees by Assigned Position, Fall Staff, and Salaries; Fall Enrollment (EF); Graduation Rates

(GR); Outcome Measures (OM); Finance (F); and Academic Libraries (AL).

Native Hawaiian or Other

A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands.

Pacific Islander

The amount of time necessary for a student to complete all requirements for a degree or certificate according to the institution's catalog. This is typically 4 years (8 semesters or trimesters, or 12 quarters, excluding summer sessions) for a

Normal time to completion bachelor's degree in a standard term-based institution; 2 years (4 semesters or trimesters, or 6 quarters, excluding summer

sessions) for an associate's degree in a standard term-based institution; and the various scheduled times for certificate

programs.

Other degree/certificate- A subset of students belonging to a GR cohort who were seeking a degree or certificate other than bachelor's degree upon seeking (DGCS) subcohort entry.

Race and ethnicity unknown The category used to report students or employees whose race and ethnicity are not known.

Categories developed in 1997 by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) that are used to describe groups to which individuals belong, identify with, or belong in the eyes of the community. The categories do not denote scientific definitions of anthropological origins. The designations are used to categorize U.S. citizens, residents, and other eligible non-citizens.

Individuals are asked to first designate ethnicity as:

- Hispanic or Latino or

- Not Hispanic or Latino

Race/ethnicity

Second, individuals are asked to indicate all races that apply among the following:

- American Indian or Alaska Native

- Asian

- Black or African American

- Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander

- White

Also known as the "Student Right-to-Know and Campus Security Act" (P.L. 101-542), which was passed by Congress November

9, 1990. Title I, Section 103, requires institutions eligible for Title IV funding to calculate completion or graduation rates of certificate- or degree-seeking, full-time students entering that institution, and to disclose these rates to all students and prospective students. Further, Section 104 requires each institution that participates in any Title IV program and is attended by students receiving athletically-related student aid to submit a report to the Secretary of Education annually. This report is to

contain, among other things, graduation/completion rates of all students as well as students receiving athletically-related student aid by race/ethnicity and gender and by sport, and the average completion or graduation rate for the four most recent years. These data are also required to be disclosed to parents, coaches, and potential student athletes when the institution

offers athletically-related student aid. The Graduation Rates component of IPEDS was developed specifically to help institutions respond to these requirements. See Graduation Rates for the current description of data collected.

A predefined subset of the initial cohort or the revised cohort established for tracking purposes. Degree/certificate-seeking

Subcohort students in the bachelor's degree-seeking group in the Graduation Rates (GR) component and Pell-Grant, non-first-time, part-

time students in the Outcome Measures (OM) component are examples of subcohorts.

An institution that has a written agreement with the Secretary of Education that allows the institution to participate in any of the Title IV federal student financial assistance programs (other than the Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnerships or LEAP,
