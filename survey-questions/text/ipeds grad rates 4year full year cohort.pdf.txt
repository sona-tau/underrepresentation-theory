Establishing cohorts

Based on your institution's response to the predominant calendar system question (Section 1 - Part B, Question 4) on the Institutional Characteristics survey component from the IPEDS Fall 2024 data collection,

Your institution reported to the GR survey component as having the following number of students who did not complete, Full-Year Cohort (September 1, 2018 -but were still enrolled at your institution: August 31, 2019)

A fall cohort is used by institutions with standard academic terms (semester, trimester, quarter, 4-1-4). A full-year cohort is used by institutions offering primarily occupational/vocational programs and operating on a continuous basis.

Reporting Reminder:

Report Hispanic/Latino individuals of any race as Hispanic/Latino

Report race for non-Hispanic/Latino individuals only

NOTE: Reporting using the new race/ethnicity categories is now mandatory. On this screen you will need to establish your 2018 cohort of full-time, first-time

degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students using the new race/ethnicity categories. For information and assistance with this, please visit the IPEDS

Race/Ethnicity Information Center.

In the columns below, report the status of those students in the BACHELOR'S OR EQUIVALENT DEGREE-SEEKING SUBCOHORT listed in Column 10 who did

not complete a program within 150% of normal time to completion.

Report transfers-out who did not complete a program in Column 30. If the mission of your institution includes providing substantial preparation for students to enroll in another eligible institution WITHOUT having completed a program, you must report transfer-out data in Column 30. A school is required to report only on those students that the school knows have transferred to another eligible institution. A school must document that the student actually transferred. If it is not part of your mission, you may report transfer-out data if you wish.

Report eligible exclusions from the subcohort in Column 45. The ONLY allowable categories for this column are: Students who died or became totaly and permanently disabled

Students who left school to serve in the armed forces (or have been called up to active duty) Students who left school to serve with a foreign aid service of the Federal Government

Column 52 [No longer enrolled] will be calculated for you. This includes students who have dropped out as well as those who completed in greater than 150% of normal time.

If you do not have any values to report in either Column 30, 45, or 51, you must enter at least one zero in a field on this screen to continue.

The purpose of this summary is to provide you an opportunity to view some of the data that, when accepted through the IPEDS quality control process, will appear

on the College Navigator website and/or your institution’s Data Feedback Report (DFR). In addition, all data reported in IPEDS survey components become publicly

available through the IPEDS Use the Data and appear as aggregated statistics in various Department of Education reports. College Navigator is updated

approximately three months after the data collection period closes and DFRs will be available through the IPEDS Use the Data and sent to your institution’s CEO at the end of 2025.

Please review your data for accuracy. If you have questions about the data displayed below or after reviewing the data reported on the survey screens, please
