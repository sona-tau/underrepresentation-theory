# Cataloging Existing Data on the Math Community

This is an opportunity to guide future work in the mathematics community.
The [American Mathematical Association](https://maa.org/) used to conduct an
annual survey of US institutions that offered degrees in mathematics.
They collected lots of different types of data.

- [ ] Start by looking at old surveys.
    - This will inform what a new survey should look like.
- [x] [Look at list of potential data sources.](#list-of-data-sources)
    - [x] Separate data sources with team.
    - [ ] Use NLP in "Missing Databases" exhibit.
    - [ ] (maybe) create an annotated list of data sources
        - How was the data collected?
        - What variables are included?
    - [ ] Discuss:
        - Sustainability of data source
        - What are the implications of losing this data source?
        - What other types of data still needs to be collected?
        - Make references to the Metamath project and the utility of research on
the STEM community to enact change.
